It stands for a complex transitional movement in Europe between medieval and modern times beginning in the 14th century in Italy and lasting into the 17th century. It marked the revival of the freedom to think and act without being controlled by any external agency. It was also a revival of the study of the ancient Greek and Roman classics. During this period, many remarkable changes took place in Europe, which had their impact on the history of the world. One of them was the disintegration of the feudal system in Europe which ushered in a new social and economic order. This marked the beginning of the modern era."

It marked the revival of the freedom to think and act without being controlled by any external agency. It was also a revival of the study of the ancient Greek and Roman classics. During this period, many remarkable changes took place in Europe, which had their impact on the history of the world. One of them was the disintegration of the feudal system in Europe which ushered in a new social and economic order. This marked the beginning of the modern era."
