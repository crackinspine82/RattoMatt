      "content_md": "The introduction of the three-tier Panchayati Raj system helped translate Gandhiji's dream of every village being a republic into reality. Key achievements include:\n\n*   The **Ministry of Rural Development** provides training to Panchayat members to implement rural development schemes like **Swarnajayanti Gram Swarozgar Yojana (SGSY)**, bringing the government closer to the people.\n*   **(a) Digitisation:** The Central government has initiated the process of digitising over 2.5 lakh Gram Panchayats. As part of the **Digital India program**, the **eGram Swaraj** portal was launched. This user-friendly, web-based portal aims to complete the digitisation of villages, maintain records of development activities, and make them accessible on mobile phones.\n*   **(b) Coordination:** The system ensures effective coordination between government programs and those of voluntary agencies.\n*   **(c) Rural Development Schemes:** The **District Rural Development Agencies (DRDAs)**, in cooperation with Zila Parishads, release funds to Gram Panchayats under schemes like the **Jawahar Gram Samridhi Yojana (JGSY)**, which aims to create demand-driven village infrastructure. The **Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), 2005**, provides 100 days of unskilled manual work to every rural household, with the Gram Panchayat acting as the implementing agency."
