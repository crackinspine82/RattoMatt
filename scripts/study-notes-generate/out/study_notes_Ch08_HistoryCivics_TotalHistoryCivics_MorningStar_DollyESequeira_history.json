      "content_md": "The period between **1206 and 1526**, when five dynasties successively ruled from Delhi, is known as the period of the **Delhi Sultanate**. The rulers of these dynasties ruled from their capital at Delhi and were called the **Sultans**.\n\nBy the 10th and 11th centuries, numerous small kingdoms emerged in North India due to the absence of a powerful central government. Constant conflict among these kingdoms and a lack of political unity were largely responsible for the quick victories of the Turks, who began their conquests in the 11th and 12th centuries and established their Empire in the 13th century."

      "content_md": "Historical sources for the Delhi Sultanate include official records, administrative manuals, biographies, autobiographies, court histories, chronicles, foreign travellers' accounts, and private correspondence. \n\nThe **'histories' (tawarikh)**, written in Persian, are an important source. These were written by learned men such as secretaries, administrators, poets, and courtiers. These authors often wrote for the Sultans hoping for rich awards. These handwritten works were often decorated with gold or silver to highlight important words and were called **illuminated manuscripts**.\n\n[Image: Four stages in the making of illuminated manuscript]"

      "content_md": "Inscriptions are valuable supplements to other historical sources. They are found on coins, monuments, milestones, and tombstones. Many inscriptions record land-grants, describe battles, or are eulogies to rulers. They provide information on the history of different rulers and local chiefs. Inscriptions are found in Sanskrit, Arabic, and sometimes both languages. For example, the first coin issued by **Muhammad Bakhtiyar Khilji** has both Arabic and Sanskrit inscriptions."

The most significant of these monuments is the **Qutub Minar** in Delhi.\n\n### Qutub Minar\nIt was started by **Qutub-ud-din Aibak** and dedicated to the Sufi saint, **Qutb-ud-din Bakhtiyar Kaki**. The structure was completed by **Iltutmish**.\n\n**Special Features:**\n*   **(a) Height and Storeys:** Originally, it was 71.4 metres high with four storeys. It was damaged by lightning in 1369, and **Feroz Shah Tughluq** repaired it and raised its height.\n*   **(b) Structure:** It has five storeys that taper as they ascend. Each storey is separated by a projecting balcony.\n*   **(c) Entrance:** The entrance is through a doorway on the northern side.\n*   **(d) Dimensions:** It is a circular tower with a diameter of about 13.8 metres at the base, tapering to around 3 metres at the summit. It has a circular stairway of 379 steps.\n*   **(e) Materials:** Red sandstone, marble, and grey quartzite were used in its construction.\n*   **(f) Balconies:** Each storey has a projecting balcony, supported in a way that the entire structure takes the load of the weight.\n*   **(g) Inscriptions:** Verses from the Holy Quran and intricate carvings with floral motifs are inscribed on the tower.\n\n[Image: Qutub-ud-din Aibak]"

Ghori left his slave general, **Qutub-ud-din Aibak**, as viceroy of the conquered lands."

      "content_md": "**Qutubuddin Aibak** is regarded as the founder of the **Slave dynasty**. The early rulers of this dynasty were called the **'Mamluk' Sultans**. 'Mamluk' is an Arabic word for 'owned', as these Sultans were either former slaves of the Turks or sons of slaves.\n\n*   **Conquests:** He embarked on a series of conquests, capturing the fort of Kalinjar in Bundelkhand and Anhilwara (capital of Solankis) in Gujarat.\n*   **Patron of Scholars:** He was a man of letters, and scholars like Hasan Nizami and Fakhre Mudir adorned his court.\n*   **Title of 'Lakhbaksh':** Due to his liberal distribution of money, he earned the title of **'Lakhbaksh'**.\n*   **Architectural Contribution:** He laid the foundation of the **Qutub Minar** in Delhi, named after the Sufi saint Khwaja Qutub-ud-din Bakhtiyar Kaki. It was completed by Iltutmish.\n*   **Death:** In 1210, Aibak died from a sudden fall from a horse while playing **chaugan** (polo) in Lahore.\n*   **Succession:** His son, Aram Shah, an incapable ruler, was overthrown by **Iltutmish**, Aibak's slave and son-in-law. Iltutmish later nominated his daughter, **Razia**, as his successor. After a brief rule by Iltutmish's son Ruknuddin, Razia became the first woman ruler of the Delhi Sultanate."

      "level_label": "Subtopic",
      "content_md": "Upon ascending the throne, Alauddin faced and suppressed a rebellion of Mongols near Delhi by having many of them massacred. By 1305, he had conquered most of northern India, including Malwa, Ujjain, Dhar, Chanderi, and Mandu. He maintained a strong army and paid his soldiers in cash.\n\n**Market Regulations:**\nAlauddin is renowned for his market regulations. He fixed the cost of all commodities, such as foodgrains, sugar, and cooking oil. He established three markets at Delhi:\n1.  For food grains\n2.  For costly cloth\n3.  For horses, slaves, and cattle\n\nEach market was supervised by a controller of market (**shahna**). Strict punishments were enforced for cheating and using underweight measures.\n\n### Deccan Expedition\nAlauddin Khilji was the first Sultan to send an expedition to the Deccan, led by **Malik Kafur**. The kingdoms of Devagiri, Warangal, Dwarasamudra, and Madurai were conquered but not annexed for two main reasons:\n1.  He realised it would be difficult to control these distant lands from Delhi.\n2.  He was more interested in acquiring their wealth to maintain his large army.\nThe Deccan rulers were forced to accept Alauddin's overlordship and pay annual tribute.\n\n### Measures against Nobility\nTo crush the power of the nobles and prevent rebellions, Alauddin implemented several measures:\n*   **(i)** Nobles were not allowed to hold parties, festivities, or form marriage alliances without the Sultan's permission.\n*   **(ii)** The use of wine and intoxicants was banned.\n*   **(iii)** Gambling was forbidden, and offenders were severely punished.\n*   **(iv)** He stopped paying soldiers with land grants and introduced cash salaries.\n*   **(v)** He established an efficient spy system to monitor the activities of the nobles.\n\n### Military Reforms\nAlauddin was the first Delhi Sultan to lay the foundation of a **permanent standing army**. His key military reforms were:\n*   He imported high-quality horses.\n*   He started the system of **branding horses (dagh)** to prevent them from being replaced with inferior ones.\n*   He introduced the system of **chehra**, a kind of identity card for every soldier.\n*   He personally approved all army recruitments and paid soldiers in cash from the royal treasury.\n\n### Revenue Reforms\nTo maximize revenue, Alauddin introduced important measures:\n*   He brought all the land of the empire under his direct control.\n*   He introduced the practice of measuring land and fixing the state's share accordingly.\n*   He increased the land revenue from one-third to one-half.\n*   He demanded that revenue be paid in cash, not in kind.\n*   He appointed special officers to collect land revenue."

      "content_md": "Muhammad Bin Tughlaq shifted his capital from Delhi to **Devagiri** (near modern Aurangabad) and renamed it **Daulatabad**. He did this for the following reasons:\n*   **Daulatabad** was centrally located, making it easier to control the Deccan territories.\n*   Delhi was in the grip of a severe famine.\n*   Delhi was constantly threatened by Mongol invasions.\n\nHe ordered the entire population of Delhi, including religious heads, to move to Daulatabad. Later, realising the gravity of the threat from the north-west, he decided to shift the capital back to Delhi. This move caused immense hardship for the people."

      "content_md": "Another controversial step was the introduction of **\"token currency\"**. This involved issuing **bronze tankas** that had the same value as **silver tankas**. This was done due to a shortage of silver in the empire.\n\nThe experiment failed because of the widespread circulation of **counterfeit (fake) coins**. This caused chaos in trade and commerce, forcing the Sultan to withdraw the token currency."

To raise revenue, he increased the land tax in the fertile **Ganga-Yamuna doab** region.\n\nCoincidentally, a severe famine broke out in the area. The people refused to pay the extra taxes and rebelled. However, the tax collectors showed no mercy and used stern measures to collect the taxes. This forced many peasants to abandon their lands and flee to the jungles.\n\nAlthough Muhammad Bin Tughlaq later took steps to mitigate the famine (free grain distribution, loans, irrigation facilities), it was too late. Many people died of starvation, and agriculture suffered a major setback."

The Sultan himself was the commander-in-chief.\n*   **Other Departments:** \n    *   **Diwan-i-risalat:** Dealt with religious matters, presided over by the Chief Sadar, who was usually a leading **qazi** (head of the justice department).\n    *   **Diwan-i-insha:** Dealt with state correspondence.\n\n**Provincial Administration:**\n*   The empire was divided into provinces called **'iqtas'**, each under an official called a **'muqti'**.\n*   Provinces were further divided into **'shiqs'** and **'parganas'** (districts).\n*   The village was the lowest administrative unit.\n*   **Village Officials:** Included the **'muqaddam'** (village headman), the **'patwari'** (record-keeper), and the **'mushrif'** (village accountant). Each village also had a **panchayat** to settle local disputes.\n\n**Nobles and the Iqta System:**\n*   **Nobles** were an extremely powerful group, holding positions as provincial governors and military commanders.\n*   The **'iqta system'** was the practice of giving grants of revenue from a territory.\n*   Those who received these grants were called **'iqtadars'**. From the grant, iqtadars had to maintain themselves, their families, and a contingent of soldiers for the Sultan's use during war.\n*   When the central authority weakened, many iqtadars began to function as independent rulers of their territories."
