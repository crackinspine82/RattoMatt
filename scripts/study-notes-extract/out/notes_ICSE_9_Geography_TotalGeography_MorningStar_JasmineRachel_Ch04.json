It is found at about **8 km beneath the oceans** and about **32 km beneath the continents**.\n*   It has the characteristics of both the upper layer (the crust) and its bottom layer (the Mantle).\n\nBecause of the continuous changes in the earth's crust due to forces of nature, the thickness of the lithosphere is very fragile compared to the nature and composition of the earth. The **Theory of Continental Drift** put forward by **Wegener** in the early 20th century and the **Theory of Plate Tectonics** put forth in 1960s suggest that the earth's crust undergoes structural changes. Besides, the lateral movements give the earth a new shape though very slowly over millions of years."
