It also refers to the ancient Roman symbol of power: the fasces, a bundle of sticks bound to an axe that symbolised civic unity and the authority of Roman officials to punish wrongdoers. Thus, 'Fascism' means autocracy or dictatorship where the power of the State is vested in one man only; and it is obligatory for all the others to obey his orders. Fascism was an intensely nationalistic, anti-communistic and anti-democratic movement which served as a model to dictatorial regimes in Italy and Germany.\n\n[Image: The Fasces]"

The economic life of the country was organised with the objective of **removing unemployment** and making the nation **self-sufficient**. For this, the following measures were taken:\n\n[Image: Hitler started rearmament in violation of the Treaty of Versailles]\n\n*   **Factories** were set up to provide work to the labourers.\n*   **Industrial and agricultural production** and trade were encouraged.\n*   A **Food Corporation** was established to control food production, its pricing and distribution.\n*   **Price controls** were introduced and incentives were provided for workers.\n*   **Capitalists** were encouraged to increase production and **strikes were banned**.\n*   **Imports and exports** were controlled to maintain favourable trade balance.\n*   The production of **heavy armaments**, aeroplanes and naval ships on a large scale was increased.\n*   Projects of **public works**, building government offices, stadiums, art galleries; housing development, etc., were undertaken.\n*   The **trade unions were dissolved**. All the workers were put under one union whose chief was a harsh Nazi leader. He assured the workers of safeguarding their interests and rights.\n\nThus, Hitler freed Germany from the economic crisis and put an end to the problem of unemployment. The industrial production almost doubled and the foreign trade also expanded."

Thus, 'Fascism' means autocracy or dictatorship where the power of the State is vested in one man only; and it is obligatory for all the others to obey his orders.
