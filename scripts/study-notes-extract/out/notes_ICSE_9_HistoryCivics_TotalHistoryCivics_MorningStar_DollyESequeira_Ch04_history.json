With the help of Chanakya he embarked on the consolidation process of his empire.\n\nIn **305 BC**, India was again attacked by **Seleucus**, a former general under Alexander. Chandragupta defeated Seleucus. According to the treaty signed with Seleucus, Chandragupta got **Kabul, Kandahar, Herat and Baluchistan** from the Greek commander. Seleucus gave his daughter Helen, in marriage to Chandragupta. After this victory Chandragupta appointed **Pushyagupta** as the governor of his North-Western province.
