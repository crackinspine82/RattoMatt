Under this, all Gram Panchayats will be converted to **'digital' Panchayats** to provide **speedy delivery of government services and welfare schemes** to people in rural areas. As a part of the **Digital India program**, the Government of India has started the **eGram Swaraj**, a user-friendly web-based portal. It is a step towards complete digitisation of villages and will maintain all records of developmental activities of villages and will be accessible on mobile phones.\n*   Panchayati Raj system ensures **effective coordination** between government programmes and those of voluntary agencies.\n*   The **District Rural Development Agencies (DRDAs)** in close cooperation with **Zila Parishads** release funds to Gram Panchayats under the **Jawahar Gram Samridhi Yojana (JGSY)**.
