        "content_md": "Various political organisations mentioned earlier were local in character. However, their activities had prepared the ground for the creation of an all-India political association.\n\nThe Indian leaders like Surendranath Banerjee, Dadabhai Naoroji, Pherozeshah Mehta, Badruddin Tyabji and Justice Ranade were moving towards the formation of an all-India political body. Luckily for them, help in this direction came from a strange source, i.e., from Allen Octavian Hume, a retired British member of the Indian Civil Service. He wanted to set up an organisation that would draw the government's attention to the administrative drawbacks and suggest means to rectify them.\n\nHume wrote an open letter to the graduates of the Calcutta University asking them to dedicate themselves to the service of the people by forming a union to organise a well-defined course of action. This appeal produced the desired result.\n\nIn 1884 A.O. Hume, in consultation with the Indian leaders, laid the foundation of Indian National Union. That is why he is regarded as the Father or Founder the Indian National Congress. Gopal Krishna Gokhale believed that if the founder of Congress (A.O. Hume) had not been an Englishman and a retired Civil Servant, the British government would have suppressed the movement in its infancy.\n\nThe conference of the representatives of different parts of India was convened by the Union at Pune on December 25, 1885. Plague broke out in Pune at that point of time. So the meeting of the Union was held at Gokuldas Tejpal Sanskrit College, Mumbai from December 28 to 31, 1885 under the presidentship of Womesh Chandra Bonnerjee. It was attended by 72 delegates.\n\n[Image: A.O. Hume]\n\nOn the suggestion of Dadabhai Naoroji the name of the Union was changed to the Indian National Congress. Thus, the foundation of the Indian National Congress was laid on December 28, 1885.\n\nThe Viceroy, Lord Dufferin, favoured the formation of the Congress because he wanted it to act as a 'safety-valve' for popular discontent, thereby, safeguarding the British interest in India. The Congress stood for the hopes and aspirations of the people of India who accepted its leadership in launching the freedom movement. It achieved the goal of freedom in 1947."

However, their activities had prepared the ground for the creation of an all-India political association.\n\nThe Indian leaders like Surendranath Banerjee, Dadabhai Naoroji, Pherozeshah Mehta, Badruddin Tyabji and Justice Ranade were moving towards the formation of an all-India political body. Luckily for them, help in this direction came from a strange source, i.e., from Allen Octavian Hume, a retired British member of the Indian Civil Service. He wanted to set up an organisation that would draw the government's attention to the administrative drawbacks and suggest means to rectify them.\n\nHume wrote an open letter to the graduates of the Calcutta University asking them to dedicate themselves to the service of the people by forming a union to organise a well-defined course of action. This appeal produced the desired result.\n\nIn 1884 A.O. Hume, in consultation with the Indian leaders, laid the foundation of Indian National Union. That is why he is regarded as the Father or Founder the Indian National Congress. Gopal Krishna Gokhale believed that if the founder of Congress (A.O. Hume) had not been an Englishman and a retired Civil Servant, the British government would have suppressed the movement in its infancy.\n\nThe conference of the representatives of different parts of India was convened by the Union at Pune on December 25, 1885. Plague broke out in Pune at that point of time. So the meeting of the Union was held at Gokuldas Tejpal Sanskrit College, Mumbai from December 28 to 31, 1885 under the presidentship of Womesh Chandra Bonnerjee. It was attended by 72 delegates.\n\n[Image: A.O. Hume]\n\nOn the suggestion of Dadabhai Naoroji the name of the Union was changed to the Indian National Congress. Thus, the foundation of the Indian National Congress was laid on December 28, 1885.\n\nThe Viceroy, Lord Dufferin, favoured the formation of the Congress because he wanted it to act as a 'safety-valve' for popular discontent, thereby, safeguarding the British interest in India. The Congress stood for the hopes and aspirations of the people of India who accepted its leadership in launching the freedom movement. It achieved the goal of freedom in 1947."
