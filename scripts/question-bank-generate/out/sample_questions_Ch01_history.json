It created a sense of insecurity and fear among the remaining independent rulers.\n\n(ii) The annexation of Awadh on grounds of alleged misrule deeply angered Indians because:\n1. Awadh was a loyal ally of the British.\n2. The annexation was seen as a betrayal and an act of greed.\n3. It resulted in the disbanding of the Awadh army, leading to widespread unemployment and resentment.\n4. The talukdars (landlords) of Awadh lost their land and power.\n\n(iii) The disrespect shown to Bahadur Shah contributed to the revolt in the following ways:\n1. Bahadur Shah was the symbolic head of the Mughal dynasty, which still commanded respect among many Indians.\n2. The British decision to stop recognizing him as emperor and to evict his family from the Red Fort was seen as an insult to the Mughal dynasty and to Islam.\n3.

          "model_answer_text": "(i) The Subsidiary Alliance system affected the Indian rulers in the following ways:\n1. Loss of Independence: Indian rulers were forced to accept British protection and maintain British troops at their own expense, effectively losing their independence.\n2. Drain of Resources: The financial burden of maintaining British troops drained the resources of the Indian states, leading to economic hardship.\n3. Loss of Power: The Indian rulers lost control over their foreign affairs and military, making them dependent on the British.\n\n(ii) The Absentee Sovereignty of the British had significant economic impacts on India:\n1. Drain of Wealth: Wealth was systematically transferred from India to Britain through salaries, pensions, and investments, without any corresponding economic benefit for India.\n2. Neglect of Development: The British government showed little interest in the economic development of India, leading to stagnation and decline.\n3. Exploitation of Resources: Indian resources were exploited for the benefit of British industries, further impoverishing the Indian population.\n\n(iii) The long-term implications of the British policy of expansion through outright wars included:\n1. Resentment and Distrust: Wars led to widespread resentment and distrust among the Indian population, who saw the British as aggressive and expansionist.\n2. Loss of Territory and Power: Many Indian rulers lost their territories and power, leading to a sense of humiliation and a desire for revenge.\n3. Economic Disruption: Wars disrupted the Indian economy and caused widespread suffering, contributing to the overall discontent that fueled the 1857 revolt.\n4. Weakening of Traditional Structures: The wars weakened the traditional political and social structures of India, creating a vacuum that further destabilized the region.",

          "model_answer_text": "(i) The treatment given to Nana Saheb was a significant cause of the revolt because:\n1. Nana Saheb was the adopted son of Peshwa Baji Rao II and was denied his father's pension by the British after his death.\n2. This denial was seen as unjust and insensitive, causing personal humiliation and financial distress.\n3. It fueled Nana Saheb's resentment towards the British and motivated him to actively participate in the revolt.\n\n(ii) The Doctrine of Lapse was a policy of annexation used by the British where if an Indian ruler died without a natural heir, their territory would be annexed to the British Empire. Examples:\n1. Satara: Annexed in 1848 after the Raja died without a natural heir.\n2. Jhansi: Annexed in 1853 after the Raja died without a natural heir and his adopted son was not recognized.\n3. Nagpur: Annexed in 1854 after the Raja died without a natural heir.\n\n(iii) The political causes were significant contributors to the First War of Independence because:\n1. The British policy of expansion, through wars, Subsidiary Alliance and Doctrine of Lapse, created widespread resentment and fear among the Indian rulers.\n2. The disrespect shown to the Mughal Emperor, Bahadur Shah, hurt the sentiments of many Indians who still considered him their symbolic leader.\n3. The annexation of Awadh, a loyal ally, on the pretext of misrule, further alienated the Indian population.",

          "model_answer_text": "(i) The Doctrine of Lapse was a policy of annexation implemented by Lord Dalhousie, the Governor-General of India. According to this doctrine, if an Indian ruler of a dependent state died without a natural heir, his state would be annexed by the British. The adopted heir would not be recognized as the ruler.\n(ii) The three states annexed by the British under the Doctrine of Lapse were:\n    *   Satara\n    *   Nagpur\n    *   Jhansi\n(iii) The Doctrine of Lapse created widespread resentment and anxiety among Indian rulers and their subjects. It was seen as an unjust and aggressive policy of annexation that disregarded Indian traditions and customs of adoption. The annexation of states like Jhansi and Satara caused great anger among their people, who felt that their sovereignty and independence were being threatened. This resentment fueled anti-British sentiments and contributed to the outbreak of the First War of Independence.",

The Nawab of Awadh, Wajid Ali Shah, was a popular ruler, and his administration, though perhaps not perfect, was not significantly worse than that of many other Indian states. The annexation was perceived as a blatant land grab motivated by the British desire for territorial expansion, and it caused widespread resentment and a feeling of betrayal among the people of Awadh.",

It was seen as an attempt to humiliate and undermine the symbols of Indian power and authority. This created widespread resentment and contributed to the growing anti-British sentiment that fueled the First War of Independence.

The adopted heir would not be recognized as the ruler. This created resentment among the rulers.\n(iii) The political causes of the First War of Independence were significant because they directly threatened the power, prestige, and independence of Indian rulers and elites. The British policies of annexation, expansion, and disregard for Indian traditions fueled a sense of injustice and resentment among the ruling classes, who felt that their sovereignty was being undermined. This resentment was a major catalyst for the war, as these rulers provided leadership and resources to the rebellion.",

          "model_answer_text": "(i) The Subsidiary Alliance system was used by the British to expand their control over Indian states. Indian rulers who entered into a subsidiary alliance with the British had to accept British forces in their territory and pay for their maintenance. They were also restricted from having independent diplomatic relations or engaging in wars without British approval. This allowed the British to exert political influence and gradually erode the autonomy of Indian states.\n(ii) Features of the Subsidiary Alliance:\n*   Indian rulers had to accept British forces.\n*   Indian rulers had to pay for the British forces.\n*   Indian rulers could not engage in wars without British approval.\n*   Indian rulers could not have independent diplomatic relations.\n(iii) The Subsidiary Alliance led to political resentment by making Indian rulers subservient to the British. The economic burden of maintaining British troops drained the resources of the states and crippled their administration. The loss of autonomy and the interference of the British in internal affairs humiliated the rulers and fostered a sense of anger and frustration. This resentment contributed significantly to the political causes of the 1857 revolt.",

          "model_answer_text": "(i) Lord Dalhousie annexed Awadh in 1856 on the pretext of alleged misrule and maladministration by Nawab Wajid Ali Shah. The British claimed that the Nawab was incapable of governing the state effectively and that his administration was corrupt and oppressive. They used this as a justification to depose him and annex Awadh, even though the real reason was to gain control of its fertile land and strategic location.\n(ii) The immediate consequences included the deposition of Nawab Wajid Ali Shah, the disbanding of the Awadh army, and the introduction of British administration. Many soldiers and officials were rendered jobless, and the local aristocracy lost their power and privileges.\n(iii) The annexation of Awadh was a major factor contributing to the 1857 revolt because it caused widespread resentment and anger among the people of Awadh. The arbitrary deposition of the popular Nawab and the loss of livelihoods for many created a deep sense of injustice. Awadh was a major recruiting ground for the Company's army, and the sepoys felt betrayed by the British. The annexation also alienated the landed gentry (Taluqdars) who lost their estates. This widespread discontent made Awadh a hotbed of rebellion.",

Also, disrespect shown to Bahadur Shah and the treatment given to Nana Saheb contributed to the political causes.\n(ii) The 'Policy of Expansion' was a strategy used by the British East India Company to extend its control over more Indian territories, aiming for political and economic dominance. It was implemented through wars, alliances and annexation.\n(iii) The policy of expansion caused resentment among Indian rulers and their subjects as they lost their autonomy and territories. The annexations led to economic hardship, loss of power, and a feeling of insecurity, particularly among the ruling classes and their armies. This widespread discontent was a major factor that triggered the revolt.",

They established schools and hospitals to propagate their religion. They were often supported by the British administration, which led to the perception that the British were trying to undermine the existing religions of India.\n(iii) The Law of Property stated that a convert to Christianity could inherit ancestral property. This created a great deal of resentment because it was seen as a direct attack on the traditional Hindu and Muslim laws of inheritance and a way to entice people to convert to Christianity. It made people feel their religious identity was under threat and their property rights were being manipulated to advance the cause of Christianity.",

Many believed that these innovations were meant to break down the caste system and promote Christianity. The railways were seen as a way to pollute the higher castes by forcing them to travel with lower castes. The telegraph was seen as a means to spread western influence and control communication.\n(iii) Rampant corruption in the British administration was a major source of grievance for the Indian population. The police, lower courts, and other government offices were riddled with corruption. Indians were often forced to pay bribes to get their work done, and they had no recourse against corrupt officials. This bred resentment and a feeling of injustice, contributing to the overall discontent that fueled the revolt.",

(b) Many believed it was a tool for converting Indians to Christianity.\n(ii) The British government started taxing lands belonging to temples and mosques. This was seen as a direct attack on the religious sentiments of the people. The revenue collected from these taxes was used for the administration and other purposes, but the act was seen as sacrilegious and hurt the religious feelings of both Hindus and Muslims.\n(iii) The British administration often favored the rich and powerful, while neglecting the needs of the poor. The poor were subjected to heavy taxation, forced labor, and other forms of exploitation. They were denied access to justice and were often at the mercy of corrupt officials. This widespread oppression created a deep sense of resentment and anger among the poor, making them more likely to participate in the revolt against the British.",

          "model_answer_text": "(i) The British introduced new land revenue systems like the Permanent Settlement, Ryotwari System, and Mahalwari System, which often resulted in high and inflexible land taxes. This forced many landed aristocrats to sell their lands to moneylenders and merchants in order to pay the taxes, leading to their economic decline and loss of social status.\n(ii) British economic policies, such as the Drain of Wealth and the destruction of Indian industries, led to widespread poverty in India. The emphasis on cash crops over food crops, combined with heavy taxation, also contributed to frequent famines. The British government's inadequate response to these famines further aggravated the suffering of the Indian people.\n(iii) The destruction of Indian industries and handicrafts by cheap British manufactured goods led to mass unemployment, especially among artisans and craftsmen. Educated Indians also faced a lack of opportunities under British rule. This growing unemployment created widespread discontent and resentment among the Indian population, which fueled the anti-British sentiment that ultimately contributed to the First War of Independence.",

This was a problem for high caste Hindus who believed that crossing the sea would result in the loss of their caste and social standing. The sepoys perceived this as a deliberate attempt to undermine their religious beliefs.\n(iii) The lower salaries paid to Indian soldiers compared to their British counterparts created resentment. The stark disparity was seen as unfair and unjust. Furthermore, the bleak prospects of promotion within the army demoralized Indian soldiers. The highest rank an Indian soldier could achieve was that of a Subedar, regardless of merit or experience. This lack of opportunity fuelled discontent and frustration, making them more susceptible to joining a rebellion against the British.",

This allowed the sepoys to easily gain control of important centers like Meerut and Delhi at the start of the uprising. The lack of British presence made it difficult to suppress the initial revolts.\n(iii) The deprivation of allowances, such as the Bhatta (foreign service allowance) when serving in annexed territories like Awadh, severely impacted the morale of the Indian sepoys. These allowances were a significant part of their income, and their removal was seen as a betrayal of trust and a sign of disrespect. This led to widespread discontent and a decline in loyalty towards the British.",

The Indian sepoys, observing these defeats, began to perceive the British army as less invincible than previously thought. This eroded the aura of British military superiority and fostered a belief that they, the sepoys, could successfully challenge and overthrow the British rule.\n(iii) The low salaries paid to Indian sepoys, coupled with the lack of opportunities for promotion beyond a certain rank, created a deep sense of injustice and frustration. They felt undervalued and unappreciated for their service. This feeling of resentment made them more susceptible to anti-British sentiments and more willing to participate in a revolt to address their grievances.",

On 10th May 1857, their fellow soldiers broke open the jail, released them, and killed many British officers. They then marched towards Delhi.\n(ii) The capture of Delhi was significant for several reasons: It provided the rebels with a symbolic capital and rallying point. Bahadur Shah II, the Mughal emperor, was proclaimed as the leader of the revolt, giving it legitimacy. Delhi's capture inspired uprisings in other parts of India and boosted the morale of the rebels.\n(iii) Begum Hazrat Mahal played a crucial role in the Lucknow uprising. She took charge of the administration of Awadh after her husband, Nawab Wajid Ali Shah, was exiled. She organized resistance against the British forces. She fought bravely alongside the sepoys and zamindars of Awadh. She appointed her son, Birjis Qadr, as the Nawab of Awadh.",

The British government realised the need for direct control over India to ensure stability and suppress future rebellions. The widespread nature and intensity of the revolt prompted them to issue the Proclamation.\n(ii) Salient features of the Queen Victoria's Proclamation:\n    *   Assumption of Government: The British Crown assumed direct control of the Indian government, ending the East India Company's rule.\n    *   Guarantee of Rights: It assured Indians of equal protection under the law and respect for their rights and customs.\n    *   Promise of No Annexation: It promised to abstain from further territorial expansion and respect the rights and dignity of the native princes.\n(iii) The First War of Independence significantly altered the relationship between the British and the Princely States. The British adopted a policy of alliance with the princely states, recognising them as essential pillars of the Raj. The Doctrine of Lapse was abandoned, and the Princely States were assured that their territories would remain intact as long as they remained loyal to the Crown. This shift aimed to secure their support and prevent them from joining any future uprisings. The princes were encouraged to modernize their administrations and armies under British guidance, strengthening their dependence on the British.",

Examples include:\n    *   Increased Taxation: To recover the costs incurred during the war, the British imposed heavier taxes on the Indian population, particularly the peasantry, leading to further economic hardship.\n    *   Expansion of British Industries: The war provided an opportunity for British industries to expand their market in India by suppressing Indian industries. This was done through discriminatory policies that favoured British goods, further impoverishing Indian artisans and manufacturers.\n(iii) The 'Policy of Divide and Rule' aimed to prevent future unity among Indians:\n    *   Communal Division: The British fostered divisions along religious lines, playing off Hindus against Muslims to create distrust and prevent them from uniting against British rule.\n    *   Caste Division: They also exploited caste divisions, favoring certain castes over others in administration and recruitment to deepen social fragmentation.\n    *   Regionalism: The British also encouraged regional differences to prevent a unified national movement.",

          "model_answer_text": "(i) The Doctrine of Lapse was a policy of annexation employed by the British East India Company. According to this doctrine, if an Indian ruler died without a natural heir, his kingdom would 'lapse' and be annexed by the Company. Two states annexed using this policy were Jhansi and Satara.\n(ii) The annexation of Awadh on the pretext of alleged misrule was deeply resented by the people of Awadh and the sepoys in the Bengal Army, many of whom came from Awadh. The annexation led to widespread unemployment among the nobles, officials, and soldiers of Awadh, and it caused economic hardship for the peasantry. The annexation was seen as an act of betrayal and injustice by the British, and it fueled anti-British sentiment.\n(iii) Nana Saheb was the adopted son of the last Peshwa, Baji Rao II. After Baji Rao II's death, the British refused to continue the pension that had been granted to him, arguing that Nana Saheb was not a natural heir. This denial of pension was a major grievance. Nana Saheb also felt humiliated by the British refusal to grant him the titles and privileges that his father had enjoyed. This perceived injustice motivated him to become a leader in the 1857 uprising, especially in the Kanpur region.",

          "model_answer_text": "(i) The Subsidiary Alliance system, imposed by Lord Wellesley, forced Indian rulers to accept British troops in their territories and pay for their maintenance. This made the rulers dependent on the British for protection, reducing their own military strength and independence. It also drained their resources, leading to financial difficulties and resentment.\n(ii) The disrespect shown to Bahadur Shah Zafar, the last Mughal emperor, was a significant factor in fueling the revolt because he was a symbol of the Mughal dynasty, which had ruled India for centuries. Two instances of disrespect include: (1) Lord Dalhousie's announcement that Bahadur Shah's successors would not be allowed to use the title of 'King' and would have to move out of the Red Fort. (2) Lord Canning's declaration that after Bahadur Shah's death, the Mughal dynasty would be abolished completely.\n(iii) The 'Absentee Sovereignty of the British' refers to the fact that the British rulers were physically absent from India, governing from afar. This led to a lack of understanding of local customs, traditions, and grievances. Decisions were made in London without considering the impact on the Indian population. The British officials in India were often insensitive and arrogant, further alienating the people. This created a sense of disconnect between the rulers and the ruled, contributing to the growing discontent.",

[3] (iii) How did the annexation of Awadh 'on the pretext of alleged misrule' contribute to the outbreak of the First War of Independence? [4]",
          "model_answer_text": "(i) The British East India Company followed a policy of expansion through various means. This expansion directly threatened the existing Indian rulers, leading to resentment and fear of losing their kingdoms. The company's wars with Indian states, the imposition of the Subsidiary Alliance, and the annexation of territories all contributed to a growing sense of insecurity and anger among the Indian population. This resentment fuelled the desire to resist British rule. \n(ii) The Doctrine of Lapse was a policy used by Lord Dalhousie to annex Indian states where the ruler died without a natural heir. If a ruler adopted an heir, the British East India Company would decide whether to recognize the adopted heir or to annex the state. States like Satara, Jhansi, and Nagpur were annexed using this doctrine. This policy caused immense anger and resentment as it violated the traditional rights of succession and disinherited rightful claimants.\n(iii) The annexation of Awadh in 1856 on the grounds of alleged misrule was a significant contributing factor. The annexation was widely perceived as unjust and high-handed, as Awadh had generally been loyal to the British. The dismissal of the Nawab Wajid Ali Shah, a popular ruler, deeply offended the people of Awadh. Disbanding the Nawab's army left many soldiers unemployed. The annexation also affected the talukdars (landowners) who lost their power and lands, leading to widespread unrest and making Awadh a major center of the uprising.",

[3] (iii) Discuss the long-term consequences of the British 'Policy of Expansion' on the relationship between the British and the Indian population. [4]",
          "model_answer_text": "(i) The Subsidiary Alliance was a treaty system introduced by Lord Wellesley. Under this system, Indian rulers were forced to accept British troops in their territory and pay for their maintenance. In return, the British promised to protect the ruler from external threats. The Indian rulers were restricted from maintaining independent armies or entering into alliances with other powers without British approval. This system effectively placed the Indian states under British control.\n(ii) The Doctrine of Lapse, used extensively by Lord Dalhousie, directly threatened the autonomy and legitimacy of Indian rulers. By annexing states on the pretext of the absence of a natural heir, the British disregarded the prevailing customs of adoption. This created a deep sense of insecurity among rulers who feared losing their kingdoms. The annexation of states like Satara, Jhansi, and Nagpur fueled widespread resentment against British rule.\n(iii) The British Policy of Expansion had profound long-term consequences on the relationship between the British and the Indian population. It led to the erosion of Indian sovereignty, economic exploitation, and cultural interference. The constant expansion caused instability and distrust. The annexation of territories and the imposition of British laws disrupted the traditional social and economic order. This policy contributed to the growing anti-British sentiment and ultimately played a crucial role in triggering the First War of Independence.",

          "model_answer_text": "(i) The British East India Company implemented the Policy of Expansion to consolidate their power and control over the Indian subcontinent. They sought to maximize their economic and political influence, secure resources, and establish a vast empire. The policy was driven by a desire for increased revenue, trade dominance, and strategic advantage over rival European powers. \n(ii) The annexation of Indian territories through outright wars had a devastating impact on the relationship between the British and Indian rulers. It demonstrated British military superiority and disregard for Indian sovereignty. Examples include the Anglo-Mysore Wars, the Anglo-Maratha Wars, and the conquest of Sindh. These wars resulted in the displacement of Indian rulers, the loss of territories, and the imposition of British administrative control. The Indian rulers felt humiliated and betrayed, which fueled resentment and resistance against British rule.\n(iii) The absentee sovereignty of the British, where ultimate authority resided in London, far removed from the realities of Indian life, exacerbated the discontent caused by the Policy of Expansion. Policies implemented by the British often lacked understanding of local customs, traditions, and concerns. This led to insensitive policies, such as interfering with land ownership and traditional power structures. The distant and impersonal nature of British rule created a disconnect between the rulers and the ruled, which further fueled resentment and contributed to the outbreak of the First War of Independence.",

          "model_answer_text": "(i) Lord Dalhousie's 'Policy of Expansion' was more aggressive and systematic compared to his predecessors. He employed various methods like the Doctrine of Lapse, annexation on the pretext of misrule, and outright wars to expand British territories. Earlier policies were relatively cautious and focused more on indirect control through subsidiary alliances.\n(ii) The Policy of Expansion impacted the relationship between the British and Indian rulers in the following ways:\n    *   It created a sense of insecurity and distrust among the rulers.\n    *   It led to the annexation of several states, dispossessing the rulers and their families.\n    *   It increased British control over Indian affairs, diminishing the power and autonomy of Indian rulers.\n(iii) The 'Policy of Expansion' directly led to the First War of Independence by creating widespread resentment and anger among the Indian population, particularly among the dispossessed rulers, their dependents, and soldiers. The annexation of territories like Awadh and Jhansi fueled strong opposition and a desire to restore their lost kingdoms. The policy was perceived as a direct threat to the existing social and political order, leading to a united front against the British.",

Many Indian rulers felt threatened by the British East India Company's aggressive annexation policies and feared losing their kingdoms. The annexation of states created a power vacuum and increased British influence over Indian affairs. The Indian rulers felt that the British were constantly encroaching upon their territories and eroding their sovereignty.\n(ii) The Indian rulers resented the British due to the 'Policy of Expansion' for the following reasons:\n    *   Loss of their territories and kingdoms through annexation.\n    *   Loss of political power and autonomy.\n    *   Economic hardship caused by the disruption of trade and revenue systems.\n(iii) The 'Policy of Expansion' affected the sepoys in the British army by creating a sense of unease and resentment. Many sepoys came from families that had been directly affected by the annexation policies, and they felt a sense of solidarity with the dispossessed rulers and their people. The sepoys also feared that the British would eventually annex their own regions, leading to a loss of their privileges and social standing. This combination of factors led to their participation in the revolt.",

Their expansion was driven by a desire to maximize profits and consolidate their power in India.\n(ii) The implementation of these expansionist policies created a sense of distrust and animosity by undermining the sovereignty of Indian rulers, dispossessing local elites, and imposing British control over their territories. The arbitrary nature of these policies, coupled with the lack of consultation with Indian leaders, fostered resentment and a sense of injustice among the Indian population.\n(iii) The long-term consequences of the 'Policy of Expansion' were far-reaching. It laid the foundation for a centralized British administration in India, but also sowed the seeds of future conflict and resistance. The exploitation of Indian resources and the suppression of Indian industries led to economic hardship and widespread discontent.

          "model_answer_text": "(i) The Subsidiary Alliance was essentially a treaty between the British East India Company and Indian states. Indian rulers who entered into this alliance had to accept a British force within their territories and pay for its maintenance. They were also forbidden from having their own independent armies or engaging in negotiations with other Indian states without British consent. In return, the British promised to protect them from external threats.\n(ii) Hyderabad and Awadh were two prominent states that were brought under British control through the Subsidiary Alliance.\n(iii) The Subsidiary Alliance led to resentment in several ways. Firstly, it reduced the independence of Indian rulers, making them subservient to the British. Secondly, the financial burden of maintaining the British forces drained the resources of the states, leading to economic hardship for the people. Thirdly, the disbanding of the native armies resulted in unemployment and discontent among the soldiers, who formed a significant part of the population. The loss of autonomy, economic strain, and unemployment collectively contributed to widespread resentment against the British, which ultimately fueled the First War of Independence.",

The disbanding of the state armies created unemployment and resentment among the soldiers. The annexation also disrupted the existing social and economic order, leading to economic hardship for many.

This 'pretext of alleged misrule' served as a justification for British intervention and annexation, even if the actual conditions in the state did not warrant such action. This policy allowed the British to expand their empire under the guise of bringing good governance.\n(ii) Awadh was annexed by the British on the pretext of alleged misrule.\n(iii) The annexation of Awadh on the grounds of misrule was particularly egregious. The administration of Awadh was deliberately undermined by the British, and then this was used as justification. It was a fertile and prosperous region, and the annexation caused widespread resentment among all sections of the population – the ruling family, the landed aristocracy (talukdars) and the soldiers who were unemployed due to the disbanding of the Nawab's army. The annexation deeply affected the sepoys in the British army, many of whom hailed from Awadh, as they felt that their families had been unjustly deprived of their livelihoods and status. This widespread discontent played a significant role in the outbreak of the First War of Independence.",

Through superior military technology and tactics, the British were able to defeat many Indian states and seize their land.\n(ii) The Anglo-Mysore Wars and the Anglo-Sikh Wars were two significant wars fought by the British to expand their territories.\n(iii) The expansionist policy through outright wars instilled fear and resentment among the Indian population. The loss of territory and sovereignty was a humiliation for the Indian rulers and their subjects. The economic exploitation that followed these conquests further aggravated the situation. The wars also created a large class of unemployed soldiers and displaced people, adding to the unrest and contributing to the anti-British sentiment that fueled the First War of Independence.",

          "model_answer_text": "(i) The British introduced several social reforms that interfered with Indian social customs, including the abolition of Sati in 1829, which was viewed by some as an attack on Hindu tradition. They also passed the Widow Remarriage Act in 1856, allowing widows to remarry, which was again seen as interference. Efforts to suppress infanticide, the practice of killing female infants, also met with resistance. \n(ii) Christian missionaries were actively involved in proselytizing and converting Indians to Christianity. They established schools and hospitals, which, while providing services, also served as platforms for propagating their religious beliefs. Their open criticism of Hindu and Muslim religions offended many, who saw it as an attempt to undermine their faiths and culture. Furthermore, some missionaries were accused of using coercive methods to convert people.\n(iii) The introduction of modern innovations such as railways and telegraphs led to apprehensions among the Indian population. Railways were seen as a threat to the caste system, as people from different castes were forced to travel together. The telegraph was viewed with suspicion and distrust, with rumours circulating that it was being used to spread anti-religious messages. The printing press also faced resistance from some sections of society who feared it would undermine traditional knowledge and social order.",

[4] (iii) In what ways did corruption in administration and oppression of the poor fuel resentment against the British rule? [4]",
          "model_answer_text": "(i) The British practiced a policy of racial discrimination, where Indians were treated as inferior to Europeans. This was evident in various aspects of life, including access to employment, social spaces, and justice. Indians were often denied high-ranking positions in the administration and army, regardless of their merit. They also faced discrimination in social settings, with Europeans often segregating themselves and treating Indians with disdain. This blatant inequality fueled resentment and a sense of injustice among the Indian population.\n(ii) The British policy of taxing religious places, such as temples and mosques, was seen as an attack on religious freedom and a violation of long-held traditions. This measure angered religious leaders and devotees alike. The Law of Property, which aimed to introduce a more equitable system of inheritance, also created anxieties. The law stipulated that those who converted to Christianity would not lose their right to inherit ancestral property, which was viewed as an incentive for conversion and a threat to traditional family structures and religious identity.\n(iii) Widespread corruption in the British administration further alienated the Indian population. Bribery and extortion were rampant, with officials demanding bribes for even basic services. This corruption disproportionately affected the poor, who were often forced to pay exorbitant sums to get their grievances addressed. The oppression of the poor through heavy taxation and unfair land revenue policies also contributed to the growing discontent. Peasants were often forced into debt and faced eviction from their lands, leading to widespread poverty and destitution. The combination of corruption and oppression created a climate of anger and resentment against the British rule.",

          "model_answer_text": "(i) The British exploited India's economic resources by extracting raw materials at cheap prices and exporting them to Britain. They also imposed heavy taxes on Indian farmers and artisans, and implemented policies that favored British industries over Indian ones. Further, the permanent settlement created a class of zamindars who exploited the peasants.\n(ii) The decay of cottage industries and handicrafts had a devastating impact on the Indian economy. It led to widespread unemployment among artisans and craftsmen. It also increased India's dependence on British manufactured goods, which were often cheaper but of lower quality. This drain of wealth from India to Britain further weakened the Indian economy.\n(iii) The economic decline of the peasantry was a major cause of the 1857 revolt. High land taxes, coupled with the destruction of traditional village industries, forced many peasants into debt and poverty. The introduction of new land revenue systems, such as the Ryotwari and Mahalwari systems, often resulted in increased exploitation. When peasants could not pay taxes, their lands were confiscated, leading to resentment and anger against the British. This desperation fuelled participation in the revolt.",

There was discrimination in promotions, and they were often assigned the most difficult and dangerous tasks. Furthermore, they were denied equal opportunities and privileges enjoyed by their British counterparts, leading to a sense of injustice and humiliation. They were also punished severely for minor offences.\n(ii) The General Service Enlistment Act of 1856 required new recruits to serve anywhere the British government directed, including overseas. This was a major issue for many sepoys, particularly high-caste Hindus, as crossing the sea was against their religious beliefs and customs. They feared losing their caste and social standing if they complied with the Act, causing widespread resentment and fueling the belief that the British were deliberately undermining their religious practices.\n(iii) Indian soldiers were paid significantly lower salaries than their British counterparts, despite performing similar duties and bearing the same risks. This disparity created a deep sense of injustice and resentment. Furthermore, the prospects for promotion were bleak for Indian soldiers, as they were rarely promoted to higher ranks, regardless of their experience or competence. This lack of opportunity further demoralized them and reinforced the perception that they were treated as second-class citizens within the army. These factors combined to create a volatile environment ripe for rebellion.",

          "model_answer_text": "(i) At Meerut, on April 24, 1857, 85 sepoys of the 3rd Native Cavalry refused to use the new cartridges greased with animal fat. They were court-martialed and sentenced to long terms of imprisonment on May 9. On May 10, the remaining sepoys revolted, freed their imprisoned comrades, and killed British officers. They then marched towards Delhi. This incident ignited the widespread revolt.\n(ii) The capture of Delhi was significant because it provided the rebels with a symbolic center. Delhi was the former Mughal capital and the seat of Mughal power. The sepoys proclaimed Bahadur Shah II, the aged Mughal emperor, as their leader, lending legitimacy to the rebellion and galvanizing support from various sections of Indian society. It provided a rallying point against British rule. The capture inspired rebellions in other regions.\n(iii) In Lucknow, the revolt was led by Begum Hazrat Mahal, who placed her son Birjis Qadr on the throne. The British Residency was besieged for several months. Sir Henry Lawrence, the British Resident, was killed early in the siege. The rebels faced challenges from the well-equipped British forces. Despite fierce resistance from the rebels, who were supported by the local population, the British eventually recaptured Lucknow in March 1858 after intense fighting.",

This involved increased intervention in the affairs of Afghanistan, Nepal, and Burma.\n    *   Expansion of Influence: The British sought to extend their influence in neighboring regions to secure trade routes and prevent rival powers from gaining a foothold in the area. This led to wars and diplomatic maneuvers to control strategic territories.\n    *   Treaties and Alliances: The British forged treaties and alliances with various neighboring states to maintain stability and ensure their cooperation in safeguarding British interests in the region. These alliances often involved providing military and economic assistance in exchange for loyalty and support.",

          "model_answer_text": "(i) Following the First War of Independence, the administration of India underwent significant changes. First, the rule of the East India Company was abolished, and the British Crown assumed direct control over India. Second, the office of the Secretary of State for India was created to oversee Indian affairs in the British government. Third, the Governor-General of India was now to be known as the Viceroy and was the direct representative of the Crown. (ii) Queen Victoria's Proclamation of 1858, aimed to reassure the Indian people and improve governance. It promised non-interference in religious matters and equal protection under the law. It also declared that the British would respect the rights, dignity and honour of native princes. It also stated that qualified Indians would be admitted to the civil service. (iii) The British policy of divide and rule promoted divisions along religious and caste lines. This created mutual distrust and hostility between different communities, hindering the growth of national unity. It also fostered a climate of political instability, which the British used to justify their continued rule. Furthermore, it left a legacy of communalism that continues to affect Indian society today.",

[3]\n(iii) Analyze how the First War of Independence contributed to racial antagonism between the British and the Indians, citing specific examples. [4]",
          "model_answer_text": "(i) The First War of Independence exposed the weaknesses of the East India Company's administration and its inability to effectively govern India. The British government, fearing further unrest and recognizing the need for direct control, passed the Government of India Act in 1858. This act abolished the Company's rule and transferred the powers of government, territories, and revenues to the British Crown. The Governor-General was now appointed by the Crown and became the Viceroy of India, representing the British monarch. \n(ii) The British implemented the 'Divide and Rule' policy to weaken the unified front that emerged during the revolt. They exploited existing religious, caste, and regional differences to create divisions within Indian society. They favored certain groups, like Muslims and Sikhs, in recruitment to the army and civil services, thus creating a sense of loyalty and dependence on the British. This policy led to increased communal tensions and hindered the growth of a unified national identity. The consequences included increased social fragmentation, which helped the British maintain control but also sowed the seeds of future conflicts. \n(iii) The First War of Independence significantly worsened racial antagonism between the British and the Indians. The mutiny was perceived by the British as a betrayal, leading to a hardening of attitudes and increased discrimination. Examples include: Indians were excluded from high-ranking positions in the administration and army. The British adopted a more arrogant and aloof attitude towards Indians, treating them as inferior. Restrictions were imposed on Indians in social clubs and other public spaces. The British press often portrayed Indians in a negative light, perpetuating stereotypes and reinforcing the perception of racial difference. These actions created a climate of distrust and resentment, hindering reconciliation and fueling the nationalist movement.",

[3]\n(iii) Describe the nature and extent of economic exploitation carried out by the British government in India after the First War of Independence. [4]",
          "model_answer_text": "(i) Following the First War of Independence, the British government adopted a more cautious and pragmatic approach to foreign policy. They focused on securing the frontiers of India against external threats, particularly from Russia and Afghanistan. They pursued a policy of establishing buffer states and alliances with neighboring countries to create a defensive perimeter around India. The aim was to prevent any future external interference or support for internal rebellions. The British also became more actively involved in the affairs of the princely states to ensure their loyalty and prevent them from becoming centers of dissent.\n(ii) After the First War of Independence, the British government adopted a policy of religious neutrality, at least officially. They realized that interfering with the religious practices of Indians had been a major cause of the revolt. They withdrew support from missionary activities and avoided any direct involvement in religious matters. However, this policy was not always consistently applied, and the British continued to favor some religious groups over others in certain contexts. Despite the official policy, subtle forms of discrimination and bias persisted, contributing to continued social tensions.\n(iii) The economic exploitation of India by the British intensified after the First War of Independence. The British government tightened its control over the Indian economy to maximize its profits. This involved: Increasing taxes on land and other sources of revenue. Promoting the production of raw materials for British industries while discouraging Indian manufacturing. Imposing discriminatory tariffs and trade policies that favored British goods. Expanding the railway network to facilitate the transport of raw materials and finished goods. Investing in infrastructure projects that primarily benefited British interests. This systematic economic exploitation led to the impoverishment of the Indian population and hindered the development of a self-sufficient economy.",

This policy was perceived as aggressive and unjust, as it disregarded the Indian tradition of adoption. Several states like Satara, Jhansi, and Nagpur were annexed, causing widespread fear and anger among other rulers who felt their own kingdoms were threatened.\n(ii) The Subsidiary Alliance was a system devised by Lord Wellesley where Indian rulers were forced to accept British troops in their territory and pay for their maintenance. The rulers also had to accept a British Resident in their court. In return, the British promised to protect the rulers from external threats. However, it effectively made the Indian states dependent on the British and restricted their autonomy.\n(iii) The annexation of Awadh in 1856 on the grounds of alleged misrule was a major blow to Indian sentiment. It was a fertile and prosperous region with strong ties to the Mughal dynasty and a large number of sepoys in the British army came from there. The annexation caused widespread unemployment and resentment among the Awadh's elite, the general population and also in the army. The high-handed manner in which it was carried out, without proper justification, convinced many Indians that the British were determined to take over all of India by any means.",

          "model_answer_text": "(i) Two wars fought by the British East India Company as part of their 'Policy of Expansion' are the Anglo-Mysore Wars and the Anglo-Maratha Wars.\n(ii) These wars resulted in the annexation of significant territories, displacing local rulers and creating resentment among the population. The economic burden of these wars also fell on the Indian people through increased taxes and land revenue, leading to further discontent. The wars demonstrated the British ambition and military strength, instilling fear and insecurity among other Indian rulers.\n(iii) The British 'Policy of Expansion' fundamentally altered the socio-political landscape of India. Through outright wars, many independent kingdoms were forcibly brought under British control, leading to loss of sovereignty and political power for the local rulers. The Subsidiary Alliance system weakened the autonomy of those rulers who entered into it, making them dependent on the British. The Doctrine of Lapse further fueled insecurity and resentment, as it arbitrarily deprived rulers of their territories based on the absence of a natural heir. The annexation of Awadh on the pretext of alleged misrule was a particularly sensitive issue as it was seen as unjust and disrespectful by a large section of the Indian population, especially the sepoys who came from that region. This policy not only consolidated British power but also significantly disrupted the existing social structures, economic systems, and political order, contributing to a build-up of anger and resentment that ultimately exploded in the 1857 revolt.",

States like Satara, Nagpur, and Jhansi were annexed using this doctrine.\n(ii) The annexation of Awadh in 1856 on the pretext of alleged misrule deeply angered the people and sepoys of Awadh. The annexation led to the dismissal of officials, disbanding of the army, and imposition of a new revenue system, causing widespread unemployment and economic hardship. Many sepoys were recruited from Awadh, and the loss of their livelihood and the perceived injustice fueled resentment towards the British.\n(iii) The Subsidiary Alliance, introduced by Lord Wellesley, forced Indian rulers to disband their own armies and accept British troops stationed in their territories. The rulers had to pay for the maintenance of these troops, often leading to financial burdens. This policy deprived the rulers of their independence and military strength, making them subordinate to the British. The constant presence of British troops also interfered with the internal affairs of the states, causing further resentment and ultimately contributing to the widespread discontent that led to the 1857 revolt.",

          "model_answer_text": "(i) The Doctrine of Lapse allowed the British to annex any Indian state where the ruler died without a natural heir. This directly threatened the established succession traditions and autonomy of Indian rulers, creating deep resentment. Several states like Satara, Jhansi, and Nagpur were annexed using this doctrine, causing widespread anger and fear among the ruling class who saw it as an aggressive expansionist policy. This policy created a sense of insecurity and fueled resistance. Rulers felt insecure about the future of their kingdoms.\n(ii) The Subsidiary Alliance was a system where Indian rulers had to accept British forces in their territory and pay for their maintenance. In return, the British promised to protect them from external threats and internal rebellions. Negative impacts:\n 1. Loss of independence: Rulers effectively lost control over their foreign policy and military affairs.\n 2. Economic burden: Maintaining British troops placed a heavy strain on the state's finances.\n 3. Dissatisfaction among the people: The presence of British troops and interference in internal matters created resentment among the population.\n(iii) The annexation of Awadh had several significant consequences. The removal of the Nawab led to widespread unemployment and economic hardship, as many nobles, officials, and soldiers lost their positions. The annexation was seen as unjust and insensitive, as the Nawab was popular and the region was relatively well-governed. This created widespread resentment among the people of Awadh, who felt humiliated and betrayed. Disbanding the Nawab's army created a large number of unemployed sepoys who became active participants in the uprising, turning Awadh into a major center of rebellion. The annexation was a major factor in the widespread support for the revolt in Awadh and significantly contributed to the First War of Independence.",

Though initially the British had no intention of annexing Sindh, after Sir Charles Napier’s military success, Sindh was annexed. \n(iii) The policy of expansion through outright wars caused widespread resentment and fear among Indian rulers and the general population. The annexation of territories like Sindh and Punjab demonstrated the British East India Company's insatiable greed for land and power. This created a deep sense of insecurity and distrust, which ultimately contributed to the outbreak of the First War of Independence. Rulers who had lost their territories, along with their dispossessed armies and officials, harbored deep grievances and were eager to challenge British rule, becoming important catalysts for the revolt.",

They also lost control over their foreign affairs. The people suffered due to increased taxation to support the British troops and the loss of employment opportunities in the royal courts. (iii) The annexation of states through the Subsidiary Alliance created widespread dissatisfaction and anger among Indian rulers, nobles, and soldiers who lost their power and livelihood.

A prominent example is the annexation of Awadh in 1856 by Lord Dalhousie. The British claimed that the Nawab of Awadh was an inefficient ruler and that the people were suffering under his administration. Similarly, other states were annexed using similar justifications.\n(iii) The policy of annexation based on 'alleged misrule' created widespread resentment and distrust among the Indian population towards British rule. It led to the displacement of local rulers and elites, causing economic hardship and social disruption.

This insecurity fueled anger among the ruling class.\n(iii) The British policy of expansion created widespread discontent among Indian rulers who felt threatened by the continuous annexations. The Subsidiary Alliance placed rulers under British control, limiting their power. Annexation on the pretext of misrule, such as in Awadh, was seen as unjust and further fueled resentment.

The scale and intensity of the uprising demonstrated a need for direct British government control to ensure stability and prevent further rebellions. (iii) The Government of India Act of 1858 transferred power from the East India Company to the British Crown. Key provisions included the abolition of the Company's rule, the establishment of a Secretary of State for India responsible to the British Parliament, and the appointment of a Viceroy to represent the Crown in India. This fundamentally altered the administration by replacing Company officials with direct representatives of the British government, centralizing control in London.",

The perceived injustice and discriminatory practices strengthened the resolve of Indian nationalists and contributed to the growing demand for self-governance and ultimately, independence. It deepened the chasm and made reconciliation more difficult, leading to more radical movements later on. [4]",

They aimed to secure their borders by avoiding further conflicts and annexations. Another change was that they sought alliances and protectorates with these nations to prevent other European powers from gaining influence in the region.\n(ii) The First War of Independence demonstrated the potential for widespread rebellion against British rule. The British realized that further expansion and annexation would only increase resentment and instability. They understood that they needed to consolidate their power and secure their borders through diplomacy rather than military force. Also they needed allies amongst the powerful local rulers. The revolt made them respect the power of tradition and religious customs.\n(iii) The change in British foreign policy led to a period of relative peace and stability in the subcontinent. The British focused on consolidating their control over existing territories and establishing protectorates over neighboring states. This allowed them to maintain their dominance in the region without having to engage in costly and destabilizing wars.

          "model_answer_text": "(i) Three socio-religious causes that contributed to the revolt are: (a) Activities of Missionaries which led to fears of conversion to Christianity. (b) Apprehensions about modern innovations such as railways and telegraphs, viewed as threats to traditional society. (c) Interference with social customs such as sati and child marriage, perceived as attacks on Indian culture.\n(ii) After the revolt, the British adopted a policy of religious neutrality or non-interference. The British government became cautious about directly interfering in religious matters to avoid further provoking religious sentiments. This shift was largely a reaction to the belief that perceived religious interference was a significant cause of the 1857 revolt.\n(iii) The long-term consequences of the shift to religious neutrality were mixed. On one hand, it reduced immediate religious tensions and allowed for more stable governance. On the other hand, it contributed to a sense of distance between the rulers and the ruled. It also fostered the growth of communalism, as different religious groups organized and asserted their interests, sometimes leading to conflicts. This policy, while intended to prevent another large-scale revolt, ultimately contributed to the complex religious and political landscape of pre-independence India.",

It highlights the various methods employed by the British to annex Indian territories, including outright wars, the Subsidiary Alliance, the Doctrine of Lapse, and annexation on the pretext of alleged misrule. \n(ii) The Doctrine of Lapse caused immense resentment among Indian rulers because it allowed the British to annex states where the ruler died without a natural heir. This threatened the established order and traditions of succession. Examples include:\n    *   Satara (1848)\n    *   Nagpur (1854)\n    *   Jhansi (1853)\n(iii) The British policy of expansion through methods like the Doctrine of Lapse led to widespread resentment and a sense of insecurity among Indian rulers and their subjects. The annexation of states deprived rulers of their power and wealth, leading to frustration and anger. For example, the annexation of Awadh on the pretext of misrule deeply offended the Nawab and the people of Awadh, who felt unjustly treated.

The dispossession of Indian rulers, the imposition of British administration, and the economic exploitation that followed created widespread grievances. The First War of Independence can be seen, in part, as a culmination of the resistance against this expansionist policy.",

Indian rulers were forbidden from entering into alliances or wars with other powers without British permission. 3. A British Resident was stationed in the ruler's court. \n(ii) The Subsidiary Alliance led to resentment because: 1. Indian rulers lost their independence in foreign affairs. 2. The financial burden of maintaining British troops drained their resources. 3. The presence of British Residents gave the British undue influence in their internal affairs. This loss of autonomy and economic hardship created widespread discontent, which contributed to the First War of Independence.\n(iii) Long-term consequences of the Subsidiary Alliance: 1. Consolidation of British power: The alliance system allowed the British to extend their control over vast areas of India without direct conquest. 2. Erosion of Indian sovereignty: Indian rulers became increasingly dependent on the British, weakening their ability to resist British domination. 3. Paved the way for direct rule: The Subsidiary Alliance weakened the states and created a justification for later annexation under policies like the Doctrine of Lapse, culminating in the end of Company rule in 1857.",

          "model_answer_text": "(i) The Doctrine of Lapse was an annexation policy used by the British East India Company. It stated that if an Indian ruler died without a natural male heir, their kingdom would be annexed by the Company. Two states annexed were: Satara (annexed in 1848) and Jhansi (annexed in 1853 after the death of Raja Gangadhar Rao).\n\n(ii) The Doctrine of Lapse created widespread resentment because it was seen as unjust and aggressive. It disregarded the Indian tradition of adopting heirs. It instilled fear and insecurity among Indian rulers who felt threatened by the British. The annexations deprived rulers of their power and prestige.\n\n(iii) The Doctrine of Lapse significantly contributed to the First War of Independence. The annexed rulers and their families felt humiliated and dispossessed, fueling their desire for revenge. The discharged soldiers from the annexed states became unemployed and joined the rebellion. The policy undermined the authority of the British and encouraged other discontented elements to rise against them. This created a general atmosphere of distrust and hostility that directly led to the outbreak of the revolt in 1857. The annexation of Awadh (on the pretext of misrule) further aggravated the situation, as it affected a large and strategically important region.",

          "model_answer_text": "The annexation of Sindh through outright war in 1843 illustrates how such actions fuelled resentment. The war itself caused immediate bloodshed and displacement, impacting soldiers who fought for the Sindh rulers and the local population. Economically, the imposition of British rule led to changes in taxation and trade policies, often favouring British interests at the expense of local merchants and landowners. This disrupted the existing economic structures and caused economic hardship, especially for those reliant on traditional occupations. Furthermore, the forceful annexation, without any perceived moral or legal justification by the local population, undermined the legitimacy of British rule. This perceived injustice, combined with the economic and social disruptions, created a fertile ground for discontent that ultimately contributed to the widespread uprising of 1857, as it showcased the blatant disregard for Indian sovereignty and the Company's insatiable hunger for territory and power.",

Imagine you are a ruler of a small, nominally independent state in 1850s India, who has no natural heir but wishes to ensure your adopted son inherits your kingdom. Based on your understanding of the Doctrine of Lapse, what arguments would you present to the British authorities to dissuade them from applying the Doctrine to your state upon your death? Elaborate on the potential consequences of annexation on your state's stability and its relationship with the British.",
          "model_answer_text": "As a ruler facing the potential application of the Doctrine of Lapse, I would argue against its implementation by emphasizing the tradition of adoption recognized within Hindu law and custom. I would stress that denying my adopted son's right to rule would not only violate these established customs but also create resentment and instability within my state. Furthermore, I would highlight my state's historical loyalty and cooperation with the British, arguing that annexation would be a betrayal of this trust. I would also point out the economic contributions my state makes to the British Empire, suggesting that annexation would disrupt trade and revenue streams, negatively impacting both my state and the British. Finally, I would warn that annexation could incite rebellion among my subjects, who would view it as an unjust imposition of foreign rule, leading to costly and protracted conflicts for the British.",

Imagine you are a British administrator tasked with justifying this annexation to the British Parliament. Construct a reasoned argument, citing specific potential benefits of this annexation to the British Empire and to the people of Awadh, while acknowledging and addressing potential criticisms regarding the validity of the 'misrule' claim and the impact on local sentiments.",
          "model_answer_text": "Honourable members of Parliament, I stand before you today to address the annexation of Awadh in 1856. While I understand the concerns raised regarding the validity of our pretext of 'alleged misrule', I firmly believe this action serves the best interests of both the British Empire and the people of Awadh. \n\nFrom the perspective of the Empire, Awadh's fertile land presents immense economic opportunities for increased agricultural production, particularly of resources desired in Britain. Its strategic location provides improved control over the northern regions, strengthening our overall position in India. Furthermore, the annexation eliminates a potentially destabilizing influence, as the Nawab's administration had demonstrably failed to maintain law and order effectively.\n\nTurning to the benefit of the people of Awadh, the British administration promises to establish a just and efficient system of governance. Corruption, rampant under the Nawab, will be curtailed. Land revenue will be fixed and fairly collected, protecting peasants from arbitrary exploitation. Infrastructure projects, such as roads and irrigation, will be undertaken to improve the lives of the common people. While some may argue that the 'misrule' was exaggerated, the plain fact remains that Awadh was in a state of decline, and British administration offers a path towards stability and prosperity. I acknowledge the resentment amongst some sections of the population, particularly the landed gentry who benefited from the previous system. However, the long-term benefits of efficient governance, economic development, and protection from internal strife outweigh the short-term pain of transition. We are committed to governing Awadh with fairness and justice, earning the trust and cooperation of its people.",
