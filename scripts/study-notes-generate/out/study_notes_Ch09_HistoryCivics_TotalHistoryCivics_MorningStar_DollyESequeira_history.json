Bengal, Jaunpur, Gujarat, Malwa and Mewar had all become independent. These States were always fighting against one another with the result that a sense of insecurity and tension reigned supreme throughout the country. However, these regional kingdoms, one by one, came under the control of the Mughals."

For every ten cavalrymen, the mansabdar had to maintain twenty horses.\n\n**Jagirs and Later Changes:**\n*   Mansabdars received their salaries as revenue assignments called **jagirs**. Most mansabdars did not reside in or administer their jagirs; they only had rights to the revenue, which was collected by their servants.\n*   **Jahangir** reduced the average rate of zat salary.\n*   **Shah Jahan** reduced the number of sawars a noble was required to maintain, to about one-third or one-fourth of his sawar rank.\n*   During **Aurangzeb's** reign, a huge increase in the number of mansabdars created a shortage in the number of jagirs."
