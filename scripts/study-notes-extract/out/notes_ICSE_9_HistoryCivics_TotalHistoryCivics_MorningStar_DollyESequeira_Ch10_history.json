Languages such as **Hindi**, **Bhojpuri**, **Maithili** and **Oriya** became popular. Among important literary works of this period were **Ramcharit Manas** by **Tulsidas**, **Gurmukhi literature** of the Sikh Gurus and the **Vaishnava literature** in Bengal.\n3. The teachings of **Kabir**, **Guru Nanak**, and **Ravidas** helped reform Indian society. They tried to evolve a new social order by following the principle of **equality** and by denouncing **caste distinctions**. By exposing the futility of empty rituals, they did away with the domination of priests. Thus, the **Bhakti movement** brought in social changes."

At the age of five, after the death of his father, he came to Delhi with his mother. At the age of twenty, Nizamuddin went to **Ajodhan** (the present Pakpattan Sharif in Pakistan) and became a disciple of the Sufi saint, **Baba Farid**. Nizamuddin did not take up residence in Ajodhan but continued with his theological studies in Delhi while simultaneously starting the Sufi devotional practices. He visited Ajodhan each year to spend the month of Ramzan in the presence of Baba Farid. It was on his third visit to Ajodhan that Baba Farid made him his successor. Shortly after that, when Nizamuddin returned to Delhi, he received the news that Baba Farid had died.\n\nHe built his **Khanqah** in Delhi, a place where people from all walks of life were fed, and imparted spiritual education. Before long, the Khanqah became a place thronged with all kinds of people, rich and poor alike."

The shrine is visited by people of all faiths, throughout the year. It becomes a place for special congregation during the **urs (death anniversary)** of Hazrat Nizamuddin and Amir Khusro, who is also buried at the Nizamuddin Dargah."
