It is the only means by which a soul can be saved from the cycle of birth and rebirth.\n* Like Kabir, he believed that personal devotion to one God could lead to salvation regardless of caste, creed or sect.\n* He advocated a middle path in which spiritual life could be combined with the duties of the householder. He exhorted people to give up hypocrisy and insincerity and to lead a life of truth and honesty.\n* He condemned idolatry in all its forms."

He was followed by **Pedro Álvares Cabral** and **Alfonso de Albuquerque**. They built a fort at Kochi with permission from the **Raja of Cochin**. Within the fort, they built a church with a wooden structure. The neighbourhood is now known as **Fort Kochi**.\n\nIn **1506**, **Francisco de Almeida**, the **Portuguese viceroy**, was allowed by the **Raja of Cochin** to reconstruct wooden buildings in stone and masonry. The wooden church was rebuilt, presumably by the **Franciscan friars**, who belonged to the order of **St. Francis of Assisi** (a town in Italy). The Franciscans retained control over the church till the **Dutch** captured Kochi in **1663**.\n\nIn **1795**, the **British** captured Kochi from the Dutch and allowed the latter to retain the church.

At the age of 15, he is said to have delivered nine-thousand verses of his commentary on the **Bhagvad Gita**, called the **Jnaneswari**, also called **Bhavartha Dipika**.\n\nJnaneswar regarded **bhakti** (devotion) as the means to liberation. On the advice of his brother and Guru, Nivrittinatha to write a treatise on his spiritual experience, he wrote **Amritanubhava**.\n\nJnaneswar (or Dnyaneshwar), with his brothers and sister, did lot of pilgrimage and during one of his visits, met **Namdev** and the two became friends. Under the influence of Namdev, he joined the **Varkari movement**, which is a path combining Vedic doctrines with **jnana** (knowledge) and **bhakti** (devotion) and virtually became its leader. Its main practice is about remembering God at all times and living a simple virtuous life and helping others.\n\nHis teachings invoked great devotion in common people and his followers walk hundreds of kilometres to the holy place of **Pandhapur**, to worship **Lord Vitthal**, a form of Hari. In his famous works, known as **Abhangas**, Namdev has given a graphic description of the Sant's visit to the holy places.\n\nIn the month of **Kartik in 1296**, Sant Jnaneswar took **samadhi** at **Alandi**. His **samadhi mandir** is a highly revered religious place in Alandi, especially for the people belonging to the **Varkari sect**. He is an inspiration for millions of devotees, through his teachings and the great texts that he has left behind as his legacy."

They started a movement — preaching religious tolerance, brotherhood and oneness of God. They held that all religions were different paths of reaching the same God.\n\nThe Sufi Saints from Persia and Central Asia were organised into 12 orders or **silsilas**. The word '**silsila**' literally means a chain, signifying a continuous link between the master and the disciple. The leader of the order was called the **pir** and the followers were called the **murids**. A **wali** was nominated by the pir as his successor. Each Sufi order had **Khanqah** or hermitage where the sufi saints resided with their disciples. The sufi saints who settled in India belonged to **Chishti** and **Suhrawardi** orders."
