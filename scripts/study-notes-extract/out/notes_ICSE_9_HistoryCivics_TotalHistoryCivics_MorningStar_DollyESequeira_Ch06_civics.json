The local government in an area functions at the district level under the overall charge of a District Collector or Deputy Commissioner. A Deputy Commissioner often combines both these functions. He is also the highest officer in a district for the purpose of revenue collection and is therefore also called District Collector.\n\n**Appointment:** The Deputy Commissioner belongs to the Indian Administrative Service (IAS) and is appointed by the State government. A District Collector or Deputy Commissioner is a highly trained officer in all aspects of administration and management of local affairs.\n\n**Other Office Bearers:** A number of government officers, heading various departments, work under the Deputy Commissioner. Among these officers some are exclusively deputed to rural areas with variety of duties. These include Tehsildar, Naib Tehsildars, Kanungos, Lekhpal or Patwari all concerned with preparation and maintenance of land records and revenue collection from district down to village level. At the district level law and order is looked after by the Superintendent of Police. Under him, work deputy superintendents, inspectors and subedars. A number of villages are provided a police chowki and a chowkidar is also placed on duty in each village. Other important officers at the district level include Chief Medical Officer, Inspector of Education and District Judge, etc.\nAll of these government officers work in close cooperation and coordination with the Panchayats often through the Block Development Officer. Further the Deputy Commissioner is also represented on the Zila Parishad. Therefore, he also influences the policies and programmes of the Panchayats.\n\n**Functions:** The Deputy Commissioner is the chief executive officer of the district. As such he performs almost every function of local government in the district. These include:\n(i) Collection of Revenue.\n(ii) Maintenance and Updating of land record.\n(iii) Law and Order.\n(iv) Supervision and execution of all plans of the Union and State governments.\n(v) Provision of civic amenities and execution of public works.\n(vi) Implementation of policies and programmes in respect of Panchayati Raj institutions.\n(vii) Supersession, dissolution, holding of election, etc., in respect of Panchayati Raj institutions."

According to officials the municipality came into being in February 1863 and acted as a constituent committee to frame by laws to run the city.\n> The year also marked the setting up of the first sanitation and conservancy system with a Unani dispensary in Sadar Bazar as well as the introduction of registration births and deaths. The next year saw the introduction of fire fighting system, water supply and taxation.

      "content_md": "### THE DISTRICT ADMINISTRATION\nA distinction has already been drawn between the local self-government unit and the local government. The local government in an area functions at the district level under the overall charge of a District Collector or Deputy Commissioner. A Deputy Commissioner often combines both these functions. He is also the highest officer in a district for the purpose of revenue collection and is therefore also called District Collector.\n\n**Appointment:** The Deputy Commissioner belongs to the Indian Administrative Service (IAS) and is appointed by the State government. A District Collector or Deputy Commissioner is a highly trained officer in all aspects of administration and management of local affairs.\n\n**Other Office Bearers:** A number of government officers, heading various departments, work under the Deputy Commissioner. Among these officers some are exclusively deputed to rural areas with variety of duties. These include Tehsildar, Naib Tehsildars, Kanungos, Lekhpal or Patwari all concerned with preparation and maintenance of land records and revenue collection from district down to village level. At the district level law and order is looked after by the Superintendent of Police. Under him, work deputy superintendents, inspectors and subedars. A number of villages are provided a police chowki and a chowkidar is also placed on duty in each village. Other important officers at the district level include Chief Medical Officer, Inspector of Education and District Judge, etc.\nAll of these government officers work in close cooperation and coordination with the Panchayats often through the Block Development Officer. Further the Deputy Commissioner is also represented on the Zila Parishad. Therefore, he also influences the policies and programmes of the Panchayats.\n\n**Functions:** The Deputy Commissioner is the chief executive officer of the district. As such he performs almost every function of local government in the district. These include:\n(i) Collection of Revenue.\n(ii) Maintenance and Updating of land record.\n(iii) Law and Order.\n(iv) Supervision and execution of all plans of the Union and State governments.\n(v) Provision of civic amenities and execution of public works.\n(vi) Implementation of policies and programmes in respect of Panchayati Raj institutions.\n(vii) Supersession, dissolution, holding of election, etc., in respect of Panchayati Raj institutions."
