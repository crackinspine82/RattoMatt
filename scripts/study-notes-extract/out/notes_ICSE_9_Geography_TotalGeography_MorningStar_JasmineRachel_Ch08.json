During the volcanic eruptions, hot gases are pushed upward and they push violently the earth's crust surface upward causing earthquakes. **Volcanic activities** and seismic occurrences (**earthquakes**) are interrelated: an earthquake follows a volcanic eruption and a volcanic eruption follows an earthquake. The violent eruption of **Krakatoa volcano** between the islands of **Sumatra** and **Java** caused severe earthquake around a vast region. The earthquake generated **Tsunami** (tidal waves) which killed about 30,000 people in Java and Sumatra."

When two plates slip past each other or collide against each other, their edges produce **faults** along the lines of weakness.\n\nThe **tectonic earthquakes** are most frequent. These earthquakes are immensely powerful. They occur in high risk regions of the **'Pacific Ring' of South East Asia** (Philippines and Indonesia) and northern India, along **plate boundaries**.\n\nIn India, a severe earthquake occurred at **Bhuj in Gujarat in 2001** due to lowering of the Indian plate below the Asiatic plate."
