This is unlike the system prevailing in the USA, where one can be a citizen of the New York State as well as an American citizen. In India, a person born in Punjab or in Kerala can only be a citizen of India and not a citizen of the State of their domicile as well. This has been done to ward off separatist tendencies and promote fraternity and unity among the people.\n\nBy the **Citizenship (Amendment) Act 2003**, the Government of India has granted dual citizenship to all the **Persons of Indian Origin (PIOs)**, who migrated to other countries after January 26, 1950. All privileges of an Indian citizen except the right to vote could be enjoyed by PIOs."

The Constitution of Independent India has replaced this system by introducing **joint electorate**. According to this system, resident voters of a constituency have to vote for the same candidate irrespective of his caste or creed. Similarly, some seats are reserved for candidates from Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. All people from such constituencies have to vote for the candidates of the area. This system is aimed at curbing communal politics and fostering communal harmony."
