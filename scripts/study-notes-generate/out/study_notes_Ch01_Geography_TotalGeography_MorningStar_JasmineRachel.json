      "content_md": "Earth, our home planet, is the third planet from the sun and the fifth-largest planet in the solar system. It is the only planet which supports life. From space, the earth looks blue because 70 per cent of its total area is covered by water. Hence, it is also called the **watery planet**.\n\nThe family of the sun is called the **Solar System**. The chief members of the solar system are the planets, the satellites that revolve around the planets, and other celestial bodies called asteroids, comets, and meteorites. The planets in order of their distance from the sun are: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune."

      "level_label": "Topic",
      "content_md": "The earth is not a perfect sphere. It bulges slightly at the centre and is flattened at the poles. In the olden days, the earth was considered to be a flat disc with steep edges. **Aryabhatta**, the 5th century Indian astronomer and mathematician, believed in the round shape of the earth. He said that the earth was spherical in shape and rotated on its axis. In the 6th century, Greek philosopher **Pythagoras** said the same thing. Today, we have convincing evidence to prove that the earth is spherical in shape."

Then, as it comes closer, we can see the deck in the middle, then its funnel, and finally the hull comes into full view. This can happen only when the earth's surface is curved. If the earth were flat, the entire ship would have been visible at once.\n\n[Image: Fig. 1.1. Sighting of a ship]"

It was ensured that the poles had the same height above the water in the canal. When the poles were viewed from one end of the canal, the middle pole looked slightly higher. This could not have happened if the earth had a flat surface. A similar experiment was repeated at different places with the same result, demonstrating that the surface of the earth was curved.\n\n[Image: Fig. 1.2. Bedford level experiment]"

At the Equator, the angle is 0°. This can happen only in an arc of a circle. If the earth were flat, the Pole Star would have the same height for all latitudes.\n\n[Image: Fig. 1.3.

In the 20th century, when satellite pictures of earth were fed into computers, its spherical shape with the flattened poles was confirmed. The conclusive evidence for the proof of the earth's spherical shape is obtained from photographs taken from space.\n\n[Image: Fig. 1.4. A satellite picture of the Earth]"

Had the earth's surface been flat, the horizon would have been the same irrespective of altitude.\n\nIn modern days, all radio waves that travel over the earth's surface can be heard only within a certain horizon. Beyond this, the signal is not received. This is because of the spherical shape of the earth.\n\n[Image: Fig. 1.5(a). Spherical Earth: The higher the altitude, the wider the circular horizon. The circular horizon AB widens to CD as you move up from Y to X.]\n[Image: Fig. 1.5(b). Flat Earth: Irrespective of the altitude, the visible horizon is the same.]"

This is because the earth rotates from west to east and therefore, people in the east can see the sun earlier than those in the west.

Its diameter varies at the Equator and at the Poles.\n- Its diameter at the **Equator is 12,756 km**.\n- Its **Polar diameter is 12,714 km**.\n\nThis difference in diameter is due to the **centrifugal force** of the earth's rotation at a great speed, which forms a bulge at the Equator and a compression at the Poles. Thus, the earth is said to be an **Oblate Spheroid**. The shape of the earth is also described as **Geoid**, which means 'earth shaped'."

Some form of life thrives in virtually every part of the earth, from the coldest part of the Poles to the warmest part of the Equator.

The remaining planets in the Solar system are very cold with surface temperatures below 0°C.\n*   Venus is the second planet from the sun but is hotter than Mercury. This is because its atmosphere is mainly composed of carbon dioxide, which produces a **Greenhouse effect** on its surface, keeping the temperature very high. The earth's atmosphere contains a very small quantity of carbon dioxide."

This continuous movement is the **hydrological cycle**. A proper balance between evaporation, condensation, and precipitation is essential for life.\n*   Water can absorb enormous amounts of heat without much change in its temperature. During the day, water bodies absorb heat, keeping the earth fairly cool. At night, they release this heat, which, along with other atmospheric effects, keeps most of the surface from freezing.\n\n[Image: Fig. 1.8.

Atmospheric carbon dioxide is used by plants in the presence of sunlight and chlorophyll to make their own food by the process of **photosynthesis**. During this process, CO₂ is fixed as starch by plants. From the plants, carbon moves along the food chain through consumers at different levels. After the death of plants and animals, the carbon present in their bodies is decomposed and absorbed as food by saprophytic bacteria and fungi. When plants die and get buried in the soil, they undergo slow degradation and compaction, which results in the formation of fossil fuels.\n\nDuring respiration, plants, animals, and humans use atmospheric oxygen and release carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere. The burning of carbon-containing fuels also releases CO₂. Thus, carbon is returned to the environment through respiration, decomposition, and burning of fuels. This cyclic movement of carbon is known as the **carbon cycle**, which helps in maintaining carbon balance in nature. Any imbalance can lead to **Global Warming**.\n\n[Image: Fig. 1.11.

These cycles are nature's mechanism to maintain balance in the ecosystem."
