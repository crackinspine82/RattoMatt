      "level_label": "Section",
      "content_md": "The period of about two centuries from the early fourth century AD is known as the **Imperial Age of the Guptas**. The rulers of this dynasty established a vast empire comprising almost the entire northern India. In the process of carving such a huge empire they were facilitated by certain material advantages such as fertile land in eastern UP and Bihar and iron ore found in Central India and Bihar, which they could exploit to their advantage. The material progress thus gained enabled them to make progress in the field of literature, art and architecture, science and culture. This period is therefore, also known as the **“classical age\"** or the **'golden age'** of Indian history."

      "content_md": "**Fa-hien** was the earliest Chinese pilgrim who visited India on a religious mission during the reign of **Chandragupta II**. During his stay in India, he went on a pilgrimage to Mathura, Kannauj, Kapilavastu, Kushinagar, Vaishali, Pataliputra, Kashi and Rajagriha. He made careful unbiased observations about the conditions at that time. According to Fa-hien's accounts:\n\n*   **Magadha** was a prosperous country with large towns, teeming with wealthy population.\n*   **Pataliputra** was a flourishing city with numerous charitable institutions, including a hospital endowed by benevolent citizens.\n*   Although the people were wealthy, they led simple lives, generally observing the Buddhist rules of conduct.\n*   **Vaishnavism, Shaivism, Buddhism and Jainism** were the main religions. People, however, had no ill-will towards other sects.\n*   Hindu gods and goddesses were depicted on coins and also in sculptures and paintings.\n*   The penal code was mild and the offences were ordinarily punished by fines only.\n\n[Image: Fa-hien]\n\nFrom the above accounts, it can be inferred that the Gupta Empire was prosperous and governed on enlightened principles."

      "content_md": "This is one of the important epigraphic evidences of the Imperial-Guptas. Composed by **Harisena**, the court poet of **Samudragupta**, the **Allahabad Pillar Inscription**, also known as **Prayaga Prashasti**, is written in praise of Samudragupta, arguably the most powerful of the Gupta rulers. It describes the reign of the Guptas in ancient India. Besides, it provides an impressive list of Kings and tribal republics that were conquered by Samudragupta. The inscription is also important because of the political geography of India that it indicates by naming the different kings and peoples who populated India in the first half of the 4th century AD.\n\n**An excerpt from the Prayaga Prashasti**\nHe was without an antagonist on earth; he, by the overflowing of the multitude of (his) many good qualities adorned by hundreds of good actions, has wiped off the fame of other kings with the soles of (his) feet; (he is) Purusha (the Supreme Being), being the cause of the prosperity of the good and the destruction of the bad (he is) incomprehensible; (he is) one whose tender heart can be captured only by devotion and humility; (he is) possessed of compassion; (he is) the giver of many hundred-thousands of cows; (his) mind has received ceremonial initiation for the uplift of the miserable, the poor, the forlorn and the suffering; (he is) resplendent and embodied kindness to mankind; (he is) equal to (the gods) Kubera (the god of wealth), Varuna (the god of ocean), Indra (the god of rains) and Yama (the god of death)..."

      "content_md": "He was the son of Chandragupta I. Much of the information about him is obtained from a long inscription composed by his court poet, **Harisena**. This inscription is engraved on a Pillar at Allahabad. He was a great conqueror, an able statesman as well as a patron of arts.\n\nHis empire extended from Brahmaputra in the east to rivers Yamuna and Chambal in the west and from Himalayas in the north to Narmada in the south. It is because of his bravery and generalship that he is known as the **'Napoleon of India'**. He further extended his empire up to the Chambal river by defeating the Naga kings of Mathura, Gwalior and Ahichhatra. Like Alexander he was daring. During his famous Deccan campaign he covered more than 3,000 miles through dense forests. Though he defeated many powerful rulers, he did not annex southern territories. He made the southern kings accept his authority and allowed them to rule.\n\n[Image: Allahabad Pillar]\n\nThe **Allahabad Pillar Inscription** of Samudragupta describes four different kinds of rulers and tells us about Samudragupta's policies towards them:\n(a) The nine rulers of **Aryavarta** were uprooted and their kingdoms were made a part of Samudragupta's empire.\n(b) The twelve rulers of **Dakshinpatha** (South India), who surrendered to Samudragupta after being defeated, were liberated and allowed to rule again over their kingdoms.\n(c) The inner circle of neighbouring states, including Assam, Coastal Bengal, Nepal and a number of **gana sanghas** (organisation of many kings) in the north-west paid tribute, followed his orders and attended his court.\n(d) The rulers of the outlying areas submitted to him and offered their daughters in marriage.\n\nAccording to Samudragupta's court poet Harisena, Samudragupta performed an **Ashvamedha Yajna** or horse sacrifice. Samudragupta was not only a brave warrior and conqueror but also a great ruler, a musician and a poet. In one of his coins he is shown playing the **veena**. Samudragupta issued eight types of coins made of gold. His court was full of great scholars and literary persons.\n\nSamudragupta was a follower of Brahmanism and worshipped Lord Vishnu. He also had faith in Vedic sacrifices. But he was tolerant towards other religions.\n\n[Image: GUPTA EMPIRE]"

      "level_label": "Subtopic",
      "content_md": "The Gupta inscriptions mention that **Chandragupta II** succeeded his father, Samudragupta. He inherited the military genius of his father and extended the Gupta empire by conquest of his own. He annexed the territories of **Sakas** of Malwa, Gujarat and Saurashtra. For this he was given the title **'Sakari'** or conqueror of Sakas.\n\nAccording to noted historian, **Dr. Vincent Smith**, \"the annexation of Saurashtra and Malwa not only added to the empire, provinces of exceptional wealth and fertility, but opened up access to the ports of the western coast; and thus placed Chandragupta II in direct touch with the seaborne commerce with Europe through Egypt.\"\n\nChandragupta II entered into matrimonial alliances as a part of his foreign policy. He married **Kuberanaga** of the Naga family. The Nagas were a powerful ruling clan and this matrimonial alliance helped the Gupta ruler in expanding his empire. The marriage of Chandragupta's daughter, **Prabhavati** with the Vakataka ruler, **Rudrasena II** helped him to establish his political influence in the Deccan.\n\nIt was during the reign of Chandragupta II that the Chinese pilgrim **Fa-hien** visited India. Fa-hien does not mention the name of Chandragupta II in his accounts, but he gives interesting information on the life of the people and the general condition of the kingdom.\n\nLike Samudragupta, he issued a wide variety of gold coins. The differences in design between the coins of the two rulers are significant. Chandragupta II is represented as slaying a lion on some coins with the legend **simha-vikrama** whereas Samudragupta is shown as slaying a tiger.\n\nOn many of his coins, Chandragupta II has the title **Vikramaditya**. His court is said to have been adorned by **'nine gems'** including Kalidasa, Varahamihira and Amarsimha.\n\nHe was succeeded by **Kumaragupta**. It was during Kumaragupta's reign that **Hunas**, a barbarian tribe of Central Asia invaded India for the first time. At the time of the next attack the crown prince **Skandagupta** had ascended the throne. He gave the Hunas a crushing defeat and they did not dare attack India in the next 50 years."

It means that feudatories, i.e., local kings and smaller chiefs ruled a large part of the empire.

      "content_md": "**Monarchy** was the prevailing form of government during the Gupta period. The theory of the **divinity of kings** became popular during this period. The Gupta Kings were compared to different Gods such as **Yama, Varuna, Indra and Kubera**. They were compared to Vishnu as regards their function of preserving and protecting the people. **Lakshmi**, the goddess of prosperity, appears on many Gupta coins.\n\nThe Gupta kings enjoyed a large number of powers which covered the political, administrative, military and judicial fields. They were the **commanders-in-chief** of the army. Samudragupta, Chandragupta II and Skandagupta personally led their armies. The kings appointed all the governors and important military and civil officers. The governors and their officers had to work under the control and guidance of the king. Likewise, the central secretariat also worked under the supervision of the king. The king was the source of all honours and titles. All land in the country was the property of the king who could give away the same to anybody he pleased. He could construct dams, give shelter to foreigners, impose, recover and remit taxes and give justice. If any property was unclaimed, that went into the coffers of the king.\n\nDespite the divine elements attributed to Gupta kings, the **brahmans** as the chief custodians and interpreters of laws, exercised a check on royal power."

Among the high officers were the **kumaramatya** and the **sandhivigrahika**. The **kumaramatyas** formed the chief cadre for recruiting high functionaries. Some of the kumaramatyas functioned in their own right and maintained their regular office.\n\nThe office of the **sandhivigrahika** (minister of peace and war) first appeared under Samudragupta and Harisena held this title. The main duty of sandhivigrahika was to deal with the feudatories. In addition to these officers, there are references to a dozen other officers engaged in managing military, fiscal and rural matters. The growing importance of cavalry is supported by seals and inscriptions. Civil officials such as **amatyas**, **kumaramatyas**, etc., performed military functions or were promoted to the rank of high military officers."

      "level_label": "Subtopic",
      "content_md": "The Gupta rulers evolved the first systematic provincial and local administration, which was primarily concerned with the collection of revenues and maintenance of law and order. There were officers connected with land transaction who maintained records. Revenues might have been collected mostly in kind, but rich peasants probably paid in cash. The officer connected with the collection of tolls on commodities is known as **shaulkika**.\n\n**Provincial Administration:** The core of the Empire directly controlled by the Guptas was divided into **bhuktis**, each of which was placed under the charge of an **uparika**. The uparika was a governor appointed by the king.\n\nThe bhuktis were divided into **vishayas**, placed under the charge of the **vishayapati**. The vishaya was divided into smaller units. This pattern, however, was present mainly in the territories directly governed by Gupta kings. Elsewhere, there existed different fiscal and administrative units such as **desa**, **mandala**, **bhoga**, etc., especially in central and western India.\n\n**Village Administration:** The village administration was managed by the village headman. The Gupta inscriptions refer to the participation of leading local elements in the administration of the village or small towns called **vithis**. No land transactions could be effected without their consent and this may have been also true of other important affairs. Thus, while villages in Mauryan times were managed from above, those in the Gupta times seem to have been managed from the grassroot level.\n\n**Town Administration:** There were various towns (**janapadas**), which issued their seals and coins. They were administered by a committee of five. Some towns were being administered by some kind of **parishads**.\n\nThe towns in the Gupta Empire were usually placed under an officer called **purapala**. The leading local men were also associated with the work of administration in towns. Such people belonged to the guilds of artisans and traders which flourished during the Gupta age. **Vaishali** in Bihar was an important town where there were separate guilds of artisans (**kulika**) and of merchants (**shreshthi**)."

This is evident from the intellectual output in various fields like literature, science, mathematics, astronomy, astrology and medicine. There were many centres of learning in cities like Pataliputra, Valabhi, Ujjain, Ayodhya and Nasik. According to the inscriptions, the teachers were learned Brahmanas, who were known as **Acharyas** and **Upadhyayas** and sometimes they were also given the title of **Bhattas**. These teachers were supported by the grant of villages, called the **agraharas**, given by the Gupta rulers and charities given by generous public. The disciples, called **shishyas** had to learn fourteen sections of science (**chaturdasavidya**), comprising the four Vedas, six Vedangas, the Puranas, the Mimansa, Nyaya and Dharma, besides Vyakarana (Ashtadhyayi of Panini) and the Satasahashri-samhita or the Mahabharata.\n\nBuddhist monasteries admitted students for ten years. Learning began with the oral method, later shifting to reading literary texts. The monasteries had libraries where important manuscripts were copied and stored. Students from other countries like China and South-East Asia came for education. The monasteries were normally maintained by grants from kings and the rich mercantile class. Fa-hien also spent several years in the monastery at Pataliputra, studying Buddhist religious books.\n\nHigher education was important, with popular universities like **Takshila** and **Nalanda**. Takshila university was established before the Gupta Empire came into existence."

According to Hiuen Tsang, the whole university area was enclosed by a brick wall.\n*   **Facilities and Students:** The university provided various facilities.

An examination was held in which hardly 20% of students passed; only the most brilliant were admitted.\n*   **Decline:** Nalanda continued to be a beacon of light up to the 12th century AD when it was destroyed by **Mohammad-bin-Bakhtiyar Khilji**, a general of Mohammad Ghori.\n\n[Image: Ruins of Nalanda University]"

Sanskrit replaced Prakrit in inscriptions and in religious and philosophical literature, becoming the language of the learned and the official language for administrative purposes. Classical Sanskrit literature flourished, consisting of epics, poetry, drama, lyrics, and prose. \n\nImportant works known as **Puranas** (like Vishnu Purana, Vayu Purana, Shiva Purana, etc.) were written during this period. These texts contain stories of different Gods and describe rituals to please them. Some **Smritis** (law books) were also compiled.\n\nThe Gupta Age was distinguished by writers like **Kalidasa, Sudraka, Bhasa, Harisena, Dandin, Subandhu, and Bharavi**.\n\n**Kalidasa:**\nRegarded as the greatest poet and playwright of India. Vincent Smith compared the Gupta Age with the Elizabethan period, stating, \"In India all the lesser lights are outshone by the brilliancy of Kalidasa as in England all the smaller authors are overshadowed by Shakespeare.\"\n*   **Poetic Works:** His four poetic works are **Ritusamhara, Raghuvamsa, Meghaduta, and Kumarasambhava**. The **Meghaduta** (The Cloud Messenger) is an outstanding lyrical poetic work.\n*   **Dramatic Works:** His three dramatic works are **Vikramorvashiyam, Malavikagnimitram, and Abhijnanashakuntalam**. His work **Abhijnanashakuntalam** narrates the love story of king Dushyanta and Shakuntala, whose son Bharata later became the ruler.\n*   **Notable Feature:** A notable feature of Kalidasa's works is that characters belonging to higher castes speak in Sanskrit, while those of lower castes and women speak in Prakrit. This suggests that the status of women declined during the Gupta period.\n\nAll of Kalidasa's works have been translated into many major languages. Although the subject matter is love, nature, and beauty, they provide reliable information about the government, society, and religion of the Gupta period and contain traces of political history."
