The theory of indigenous origin posits that the civilisation evolved from local village cultures like those at Kot Diji and Amri.\n3. Striking differences in urban planning, such as the grid pattern in Indus cities versus circular patterns in Sumerian cities, are used to support the indigenous origin theory.\n4. The indigenous origin theory is strengthened by similarities in granaries, defensive walls, and long-distance trade between pre-Harappan and mature Harappan sites.\n\nWhich of the above statements are factually correct according to the provided text?",

Reason (R) provides the precise logic for why the Great Bath (mentioned in A) is considered evidence for indigenous origin – its associated practice is deeply rooted locally and lacks foreign parallels, thus R is the correct explanation for A.

The first pair, 'Tectonic Disturbances : Shift in Drainage Pattern', links a proposed geological cause to its direct effect as described in the 'Increased Aridity' theory. The second pair requires identifying the specific evidence cited for the 'Aryan Attack' theory. According to the text, historian Mortimer Wheeler's theory is supported by the discovery of skeletons of men, women, and children suggesting a massacre."

The unicorn seal indicates their mythical beliefs.\n2. Trade and Commerce: Seals were used for commercial purposes by traders to stamp their goods. This left an impression on clay which, if intact upon arrival, indicated that the goods had not been tampered with and also conveyed the identity of the sender. This points to a well-developed system of trade.",

Evidence of Flooding: At Mohenjo-daro, houses and streets were found covered with silty clay, which is evidence of repeated, massive flooding that eventually led to the settlement's abandonment.\n2. Tectonic Uplift: Hydrologist R.L. Raikes suggested that earthquakes might have raised the level of the Indus flood plains, blocking the river's passage to the sea. This would have caused the river's water level to rise, leading to the inundation of Mohenjo-daro and its surrounding areas.",

Historians found marked similarities between pre-Harappan cultures at sites like Kot Diji, Amri, and Kalibangan and the mature Harappan phase in terms of granaries, defensive walls, and long-distance trade. This suggests an evolution from these agricultural communities rather than a sudden imposition from outside.\n\nTwo arguments against the 'Foreign Origin' theory are:\n1. Excavations have revealed striking differences between Harappan and Mesopotamian civilisations, contradicting the idea that it was an offshoot of the latter.\n2. The theory that trade with Mesopotamia stimulated its growth is rejected because no evidence of such trade has been found during the early Harappan period.",

Wheat and barley grains found in the crevices of these floors indicate they were used for threshing grain.",

This discovery placed the Indian subcontinent's history at par with the other oldest civilisations of the world, like Mesopotamia and Egypt.\n\nTwo defining characteristics that classify it as a Bronze Age Civilisation are:\n1. Man had learned the art of mixing copper with tin or zinc to produce the alloy called bronze.\n2. Bronze, being harder and more ductile than copper, was extensively used for the manufacture of tools, weapons, and other implements, marking a significant technological advancement over the preceding Chalcolithic period.",

It was not alphabetical, as it had too many signs (between 375 and 400). It is regarded as pictographic because its signs represent birds, fish, and human forms.\n2.

For example, Indus cities followed a grid pattern, which was distinct from the circular, temple-centric layout of Mesopotamian cities.\n2.

Agarwal and Sood, suggests that the Harappan civilisation declined because of the drying up of the Ghaggar river system, leading to desert-like conditions.\nThe critical cause for this ecological change was tectonic disturbances. These geological events altered the river drainage patterns. Specifically, the Sutlej river, which was a tributary of the Ghaggar, was captured by the Indus river. Simultaneously, the Yamuna river shifted its course eastward to join the Ganges. This diversion of its main tributaries left the Ghaggar river waterless, causing widespread aridity and the eventual decline of the settlements dependent on it.",

The clear physical division of the city into a raised, walled-off Citadel and a lower town indicates social stratification. The Citadel, containing all the important public and administrative buildings, was likely the seat of a ruling or priestly class, physically elevated and separated from the common populace who lived in the lower town.\n2. The construction of the Citadel on massive mud brick platforms and the presence of monumental structures like the Great Bath and granaries imply a powerful authority. Such large-scale public works would require a ruling class capable of mobilising labour, collecting taxes or tribute, and overseeing complex construction projects, indicating a high degree of social and political organisation.",

          "question_text": "Read the information below related to Harappan seals and answer the questions that follow:\n\n'About 2000 seals have been discovered. Of these a great majority comprise short inscriptions with pictures. The seals were used by traders to stamp their goods. After a bag with goods was tied, a layer of wet clay was applied on the knot, and the seal was pressed on it leaving an impression. It also conveyed the identity of the sender. The seal of Pashupati shows a three-faced deity seated cross-legged on a throne, surrounded by animals. This deity has been identified as Pashupati Mahadeva. The seals also bear some kind of script which has not yet been deciphered.'\n\n(a) Explain the primary commercial purpose of the seals and the process of their use in trade. [2]\n(b) What information about the religious beliefs of the Harappans can be inferred from the Pashupati seal described in the passage? [2]\n(c) Why are the seals considered an important, yet frustrating, source for historians? [1]",
          "model_answer_text": "(a) The primary commercial purpose of the seals was for traders to stamp their goods. The process involved tying a bag of goods, applying wet clay on the knot, and then pressing the seal onto the clay. This left an impression that guaranteed the goods had not been tampered with and identified the sender or owner.\n\n(b) The Pashupati seal suggests that the Harappan people believed in a deity identified as Pashupati Mahadeva, who is considered a prototype of Lord Shiva. The depiction of a three-faced deity, seated in a yogic posture (cross-legged), and being the lord of animals (surrounded by them) indicates early forms of Shaivism and the importance of this specific god in their religion.\n\n(c) The seals are important because they provide information on trade, religion, and art, but they are frustrating because they contain a script that has not yet been deciphered, holding back a wealth of potential knowledge about the Harappan language and society.",

The figurine shows vigour, variety and ingenuity. The right arm of the dancing girl rests on the hip and the left arm is heavily bangled. It holds a small bowl against her left leg.'\n\n(a) Name the material used to make the statue and the city where it was found.

          "model_answer_text": "(a) The statue was made of bronze and was found at Mohenjo-daro.\n\n(b) Two conclusions that can be drawn are:\n1. The Harappans possessed advanced metallurgical skills. The ability to create a detailed statue from bronze, an alloy of copper and tin/zinc, indicates knowledge of mining, smelting, and the complex process of casting metal (art of mixing copper with tin). This points to technological advancement beyond simple stone or copper use.\n2. Harappan artisans had achieved a high degree of artistic skill and aesthetic sense. The description of the statue as a 'masterpiece of art' showing 'vigour, variety and ingenuity' suggests that they were not just functional craftsmen but skilled artists capable of creating lifelike, three-dimensional figures with dynamic postures. This reflects a sophisticated culture that valued art.",

          "question_text": "The following passage details two theories regarding the decline of the Harappan Civilisation. Read it carefully and answer the questions.\n\n'According to historians D.P. Agarwal and Sood, the civilisation declined because of increasing aridity and the drying up of the river Ghaggar. Tectonic disturbances caused the Sutlej to be captured by the Indus and the Yamuna to shift east, leaving the Ghaggar waterless. Separately, some scholars argue that since the civilisation was a Bronze Age culture, enormous quantities of wood were needed to produce bronze, bake bricks and pottery, and make boats. This could have led to deforestation, leading to climatic change in the region.'\n\n(a) Name the two distinct causes for the decline of the civilisation mentioned in the passage. [1]\n(b) Explain the chain of events that led to the drying up of the river Ghaggar. What was the ultimate consequence of this change? [2]\n(c) How could the technological basis of the Harappan Civilisation (being a 'Bronze Age culture') have contributed to its own decline through deforestation? Explain the connection. [2]",
          "model_answer_text": "(a) The two causes mentioned are 'Increased Aridity' (and drying up of rivers) and 'Deforestation'.\n\n(b) The chain of events was: Tectonic disturbances occurred, which caused the Ghaggar's tributaries, the Sutlej and Yamuna, to change course. The Sutlej was captured by the Indus river system, and the Yamuna shifted east to join the Ganges. This diversion of its main water sources left the river Ghaggar waterless. The ultimate consequence was an ecological disturbance and increased aridity that led to the decline of the civilisation in that region.\n\n(c) The Harappan Civilisation's technological basis as a 'Bronze Age culture' required vast amounts of wood as fuel for smelting to produce bronze. Wood was also essential for other key activities like baking millions of bricks and pottery, and for construction (boats, furniture). This massive and continuous consumption of wood could have led to widespread deforestation. Deforestation, in turn, can lead to climatic change, such as reduced rainfall and increased aridity, thereby contributing to the civilisation's decline.",

          "model_answer_text": "(a) Two materials used for making Harappan seals were terracotta and steatite. Other valid answers include agate.\n\n(b) The 'Pashupati Seal' depicts a three-faced deity wearing a buffalo-horned head-dress. The deity is seated cross-legged on a throne. It is surrounded by an elephant, a tiger, a buffalo, and a rhinoceros, with two deer at its feet. Its religious significance is that this deity has been identified as Pashupati Mahadeva, suggesting that the Harappan people believed in a deity similar to the Hindu god Shiva.\n\n(c) The seals provide significant information about Harappan trade and beliefs:\nTrade: The seals were used for commercial purposes. Traders used them to stamp their goods. An impression of the seal was made on a layer of wet clay on the knot of a bag of goods. If the seal was intact upon arrival, it proved the goods had not been tampered with and also identified the sender. The discovery of Harappan seals in other regions like Mesopotamia indicates that their trade was spread over a vast area.\nBeliefs: The seals reveal the religious and mythical beliefs of the Harappans. The Pashupati seal suggests the worship of Lord Shiva. The Unicorn seal shows their mythical beliefs. Some seals may have also been used as amulets, carried by their owners for protection or as a form of identity.",

(3)\n(c) Explain the importance of the Great Bath as a source of information about the Harappans. (5)",
          "model_answer_text": "(a) The Great Bath was discovered at Mohenjo-daro. Two materials used in its construction to make it watertight were burnt bricks and mortar, lined with bitumen and gypsum.\n\n(b) Three structural features of the Great Bath are:\n1. It consisted of a large rectangular tank in a courtyard surrounded by a corridor on all four sides.\n2. There were two flights of steps, one in the north and the other in the south, leading into the tank.\n3. Surrounding the bath were porticos and sets of rooms, with a stairway leading to an upper storey. Water was supplied by a well in an adjacent room.\n\n(c) The Great Bath is an important source of information for the following reasons:\n1. Art of Building: Its construction indicates that the art of building had reached a high degree of perfection.\n2. Existence of a Ruling Class: The massive structure suggests the existence of a ruling class that could mobilize labour and collect taxes to build such a structure for the public.\n3. Efficient Planning: The design shows efficient planning in features related to water supply and sewage disposal.\n4. Religious Purposes: Scholars believe it was used for religious purposes, possibly for ritual bathing, indicating the importance of ceremonial bathing in their culture.\n5. Standardisation: The use of standardised bricks for such a huge structure points to meticulous planning and organisation.",

(2)\n(b) State the 'Foreign Origin' theory of the Harappan Civilisation and mention one reason why it has been rejected. (3)\n(c) Explain the 'Indigenous Origin' theory. What evidence supports the idea that the Harappan Civilisation evolved from local cultures? (5)",
          "model_answer_text": "(a) The Harappan Civilisation is called a Bronze Age Civilisation because its people had learned the art of mixing copper with tin or zinc to produce the alloy called Bronze. This metal, being harder and more ductile than copper, was extensively used for the manufacture of tools, weapons, and other objects, marking a significant technological advancement.\n\n(b) The 'Foreign Origin' theory suggests that the Harappan Civilisation was an offshoot of the Mesopotamian Civilisation, brought into existence by a sudden migration of people. This theory has been rejected because excavations at Harappan sites have revealed striking differences between the Harappan and Mesopotamian Civilisations in terms of urban planning, script, and seals. Also, no evidence of trade with Mesopotamia during the early Harappan period has been found to support the idea that trade played a role in its transformation.\n\n(c) The 'Indigenous Origin' theory posits that the roots of the Harappan Civilisation lie deep in the Indian soil and it was an outgrowth of extensive local village cultures. This theory is supported by evidence of marked similarities between pre-Harappan and proto-Harappan cultures at sites like Kot Diji, Amri, and Kalibangan with the mature Harappan phase. These similarities include the presence of granaries, defensive walls, and long-distance trade in these earlier settlements. Based on this, historians have concluded that the Harappan Civilisation evolved from these pre-existing agricultural communities, possibly with some external stimulus from trade contacts.",

(2)\n(b) Mention three pieces of evidence that suggest the Harappans carried on external trade with Mesopotamia. (3)\n(c) Explain the significance of the dockyard discovered at Lothal as evidence of Harappan trade and technological skill. (5)",
          "model_answer_text": "(a) Two Harappan sites that were centres for bangle-making were Balakot and Chanhudaro.\n\n(b) Three pieces of evidence for external trade with Mesopotamia are:\n1. Mesopotamian records from about 2350 BC refer to trade relations with 'Meluha', which is believed to be the Indus region.\n2. Mesopotamian texts refer to intermediate trading stations, Dilmun (Bahrain) and Makan, which lay between Mesopotamia and Meluha.\n3. Harappan seals have been found in Mesopotamia, which were likely used to stamp goods for commercial purposes.\nOther evidence includes the depiction of ships and boats on Harappan seals.\n\n(c) The discovery of a rectangular dockyard at Lothal is highly significant. It is considered one of the oldest in the world and was connected by channels to the Gulf of Cambay, facilitating overseas trade. The discovery of stone anchors, marine shells, and seals traceable to the Persian Gulf strongly suggests Lothal was a major port. The dockyard demonstrates the Harappans' advanced hydraulic knowledge and engineering skills; it was scientifically designed to withstand water flow and had a water-locking system. This indicates their ability to manage maritime trade on a large scale and testifies to their sophisticated understanding of tides and coastal navigation, solidifying their status as a major trading civilisation.",

(1)\n(b) State two environmental factors that may have caused the decline of the Harappan Civilisation. (4)\n(c) Explain the theories of 'Floods and Earthquakes' and 'Increased Aridity' as possible causes for the decline. (5)",
          "model_answer_text": "(a) Mortimer Wheeler proposed the theory that the Aryans destroyed the Indus settlements.\n\n(b) Two environmental factors that may have caused the decline are:\n1. Deforestation: Enormous quantities of wood were needed to produce bronze, bake bricks and pottery, and make boats and furniture. This extensive use of wood could have led to deforestation, resulting in climatic change in the region.\n2. Increased Aridity: Some historians believe the civilisation declined due to increasing aridity and the drying up of the river Ghaggar. Tectonic disturbances may have caused its tributaries, the Sutlej and Yamuna, to change their course, leaving the Ghaggar waterless.\n\n(c) The theory of 'Floods and Earthquakes' suggests that recurrent floods in Mohenjo-daro, evidenced by layers of silty clay covering houses and streets, led to its abandonment. Hydrologist R.L. Raikes proposed that this was not normal flooding but was caused by earthquakes that raised the level of the Indus flood plains. This blocked the river's passage to the sea, causing it to inundate the city and its hinterland.\nThe theory of 'Increased Aridity' by historians like D.P. Agarwal and Sood suggests that a major climatic shift led to the decline. They argue that tectonic disturbances caused the Sutlej to be captured by the Indus and the Yamuna to shift eastwards, which were once tributaries of the river Ghaggar. This ecological disturbance left the Ghaggar river system waterless, leading to increased dryness and the collapse of agriculture in the region.",

In this context, answer the following questions:\n(a) Name two religious practices of the Harappans that have continued to this day. (2)\n(b) What was a remarkable agricultural achievement of the Harappan people, later adopted by the Egyptians? Mention two crafts in which the Harappans excelled. (3)\n(c) Explain the heritage of the Harappan Civilisation in the development of later cultures, with reference to both religious life and technology/crafts. (5)",
          "model_answer_text": "(a) Two religious practices of the Harappans that have continued are the worship of Pashupati (similar to Lord Shiva) and the worship of a female deity as the Mother Goddess.\n\n(b) A remarkable agricultural achievement was the cultivation of cotton, which was adopted by the Egyptians much later. Two crafts in which the Harappans excelled were bead-making and making glossy, shining pottery.\n\n(c) The heritage of the Harappan Civilisation is significant. In religious life, many of its features were found in later cultural developments. The worship of Pashupati Shiva, the Mother Goddess, and reverence for sacred trees, animals, and serpents, as well as the use of religious symbols, are practices that have continued in some form to this day. In technology and crafts, the Harappan way of making baked pottery, bricks, beads, jewellery, and textiles was adopted by later civilisations. Their achievement in cultivating cotton was a major contribution to the world. Their systems of urban planning, weights, and measures also likely influenced subsequent cultures in the subcontinent.",

(3)\n(c) Explain what the discovery of the 'Bearded Man' and the 'Dancing Girl' figurines tells us about the artistic skills of the Harappans. (5)",
          "model_answer_text": "(a) Two famous sculptures discovered at Mohenjo-daro are the stone sculpture of a 'Bearded Man' (also known as the priest-king) and the bronze statue of a 'Dancing Girl'.\n\n(b) Men wore a dhoti as a lower garment and a shawl over the shoulder as an upper garment. Women wore a skirt and used a cloak to cover their arms and shoulders. The discovery of needles suggests some clothes were stitched. Both men and women wore ornaments like necklaces, finger-rings, and bangles. Ornaments were made of gold, silver, precious stones, and ivory.\n\n(c) The 'Bearded Man' is a stone sculpture of high artistic value. It shows a man with a beard, wearing a shawl over his left shoulder. His eyes are half-closed, suggesting a state of meditation. This points to the existence of skilled artisans who could create beautiful three-dimensional figures and capture serene expressions. It is believed to be the statue of a yogi or a priest.\nThe 'Dancing Girl' is a bronze statue considered a masterpiece of art. It shows a high degree of development in the art of sculpture and metallurgy (bronze casting). The figurine shows vigour and ingenuity, with a dynamic posture. Her right arm rests on her hip and her left arm is heavily bangled, showing attention to detail. This indicates their mastery over the medium of bronze.",

Why is the civilisation also called the Indus Valley Civilisation? (2)\n(b) What are the distinctive objects that define the 'Harappan Culture' according to archaeologists? (3)\n(c) Explain the historical importance of the discovery of the Harappan Civilisation for the history of India. (5)",
          "model_answer_text": "(a) The site of Harappa was discovered in 1921. The civilisation is also called the Indus Valley Civilisation because some of its important sites that were first excavated are located in the valley of the river Indus.\n\n(b) The term 'Harappan Culture' is used by archaeologists for a group of distinctive objects found together. In the case of Harappan culture, these distinctive objects are seals, weights, stone blades, and baked bricks.\n\n(c) The discovery of the Harappan Civilisation in the 20th century was a very important event in Indian history. Before this discovery, it was believed that the history of India began with the advent of the Aryans. However, the discovery pushed back the timeline of Indian history by at least a thousand years. It established that a highly advanced, urban civilisation existed in the Indian subcontinent concurrently with the other great Bronze Age civilisations of the world, namely the Mesopotamian and Egyptian Civilisations. This discovery gave India a place among the oldest civilisations in the world and revealed a sophisticated, indigenous urban past.",

          "model_answer_text": "(a) The houses of the ruling class and important public buildings were located on the raised area of each city. This area was called the Citadel.\n\n(b) Three main features of Harappan residential houses are:\n1. They were built on high mounds to protect them from floods and had deep foundations.\n2. Houses varied in size, from single rooms to larger houses with courtyards, private wells, and toilets.\n3. Each house had a well-planned drainage system, with covered drains connected to the main street drains. Doors and windows opened onto side lanes rather than the main roads.\n\n(c) Granaries were large public buildings used for storing grain, likely collected as tax. They have been found at sites like Mohenjo-daro, Harappa, and Lothal. At Harappa, there were two rows of six granaries. They were strategically located, such as near the river Ravi at Harappa, to facilitate transport of grain by boat. They were built on raised platforms to protect the grain from floods. A key feature was the provision of ventilation to prevent the grains from becoming mildewed. The discovery of working floors for threshing grain and barracks for labourers nearby further highlights their importance as centres of economic activity.",

(3 marks)\n(c) Explain the significance of the Great Bath as a source of information. Discuss any four points. (5 marks)",
          "model_answer_text": "(a) The Great Bath was discovered at Mohenjo-daro. To make the tank watertight, burnt bricks and mortar lined with bitumen and gypsum were used.\n\n(b) Three architectural features of the Great Bath are:\n1. It is a large rectangular tank in a courtyard surrounded by a corridor on all four sides.\n2. There are two flights of steps, one in the north and the other in the south, leading into the tank.\n3. Surrounding the bath, there were porticos, sets of rooms, and a stairway leading to an upper storey. Water was supplied by a well in an adjacent room.\n\n(c) The Great Bath is a significant source of information for the following reasons:\n1. **Advanced Building Skills:** Its construction indicates that the art of building had reached a high degree of perfection. The use of standardised bricks and watertight construction techniques shows their engineering skill.\n2. **Existence of a Ruling Class:** The massive structure points to the existence of a ruling class that could mobilise labour, collect taxes, and build such a huge public structure.\n3. **Efficient Planning:** The design portrays efficient planning in structural features related to water supply from a well and sewage disposal.\n4. **Religious Beliefs:** Most scholars agree it was used for religious purposes, possibly ritual bathing. This indicates the importance attached to ceremonial bathing in their culture, a practice that has continued in India.",

This deity has been identified as Pashupati Mahadeva or Shiva.\n\n(c) The seals provide significant information about Harappan trade:\n1. **Commercial Purpose:** They were mainly used for commercial purposes. Traders used them to stamp their goods.\n2. **Securing Goods:** A layer of wet clay was applied on the knot of a bag of goods, and the seal was pressed on it. An intact seal at the destination indicated that the goods had not been tampered with.\n3. **Identity of Owner:** The impression on the goods conveyed the identity of the sender or the owner.\n4. **Vast Trade Network:** The discovery of Harappan seals in different regions, like Mesopotamia, indicates that their trade had spread over a vast area.",

(3 marks)\n(c) Explain the 'Indigenous Origin' theory. What evidence from pre-Harappan sites supports this theory? (5 marks)",
          "model_answer_text": "(a) The 'Foreign Origin' theory suggests that the Harappan civilisation did not develop locally but came into existence as a result of a sudden migration of people with an urban civilisation from elsewhere, specifically Mesopotamia, to the Indus basin.\n\n(b) This theory has been rejected for two main reasons:\n1. Excavations at various Harappan sites have revealed striking differences between the Harappan and Mesopotamian Civilisations in aspects like town planning, script, and seals.\n2. The idea that trade with Mesopotamia transformed the early Harappan phase to the mature phase is rejected because there is no evidence of trade with Mesopotamia during the early Harappan period.\n\n(c) The 'Indigenous Origin' theory, based on recent research, posits that the roots of the Harappan Civilisation lie deep in the Indian soil. It suggests that the urban Harappan culture was an outgrowth of extensive local village cultures that evolved over time. The external stimulus from trade contacts with Mesopotamia may have contributed, but the foundation was local.\nEvidence supporting this theory comes from similarities between pre-Harappan and proto-Harappan cultures at sites like Kot Diji, Amri, and Kalibangan. These sites show features like granaries, defensive walls, and long-distance trade, which were precursors to the mature Harappan phase. This continuity suggests an evolution from these earlier agricultural communities.",

Two Harappan cities in India are Lothal (Gujarat) and Kalibangan (Rajasthan).\n\n(b) Each city was divided into two parts: the 'Citadel' and the 'lower town'.\n1. The Citadel was a raised area, built on mud brick platforms. It contained important public buildings like the Great Bath, granaries, and assembly halls, and housed the ruling class.\n2. The lower town was the larger area where the general populace lived and worked in residential buildings. The Citadel was separated from the lower town by a wall.\n\n(c) Main features of streets and houses:\n**Streets:**\n1. The main streets followed a grid pattern, running from north to south or east to west.\n2. The streets crossed the main road at right angles, dividing the city into rectangular blocks.\n3. The houses at street corners were rounded to allow carts to pass easily.\n**Houses:**\n4. Residential buildings were built on a high mound to protect them from floods. They varied in size from single-room tenements to larger houses with courtyards, private wells, and toilets.\n5. Each house had covered drains connected to the street drains, and doors and windows opened onto the side lanes rather than the main roads.",

(3 marks)\n(c) What do the discoveries of woven cotton, bead-making, and pottery tell us about Harappan craftsmanship? (5 marks)",
          "model_answer_text": "(a) The bronze statue of the 'Dancing Girl' was found at Mohenjo-daro. The statue of the 'Bearded Man' was made of stone.\n\n(b) The bronze statue of the 'Dancing Girl' is considered a masterpiece of art. It shows a high degree of development in the art of sculpture. The figurine shows vigour and ingenuity. Her right arm rests on her hip and her left arm, which is heavily bangled, holds a small bowl against her left leg.\n\n(c) These discoveries highlight the advanced skills of Harappan craftsmen:\n1. **Weaving:** A piece of woven cotton discovered from Mohenjo-daro and textile impressions on other objects show that weaving was an important and well-developed craft.\n2. **Bead-making:** The Harappans knew the art of bead-making, with Lothal and Chanhudaro being important centres. This craft required precision and skill in cutting, shaping, and drilling small, hard stones.\n3. **Pottery:** The Harappans produced characteristic pottery that was made glossy and shining. Earthen vessels crafted on a potter's wheel and decorated with black geometrical designs show their artistic skill and technological knowledge in firing pottery.",

(3 marks)\n(c) Describe the 'Floods and Earthquakes' theory as a cause for the decline. What evidence from Mohenjo-daro supports this theory? (5 marks)",
          "model_answer_text": "(a) Two theories related to environmental causes are:\n1. Floods and Earthquakes.\n2. Increased Aridity and the drying up of the river Ghaggar.\n\n(b) The 'Deforestation' theory suggests that since the Indus Valley Civilisation was a Bronze Age culture, enormous quantities of wood were needed for various purposes. Wood was required to produce bronze (for fuel), to bake bricks, pottery, and stoneware, and to make boats and furniture. This large-scale consumption of wood could have led to deforestation, resulting in climatic changes in the region, which in turn contributed to the civilisation's decline.\n\n(c) The 'Floods and Earthquakes' theory posits that catastrophic flooding, possibly caused by tectonic activities, led to the decline, particularly at Mohenjo-daro. According to hydrologist R.L. Raikes, earthquakes might have raised the level of the Indus river's flood plains. This geological uplift could have blocked the river's passage to the sea, causing its water levels to rise and inundate the hinterland of Mohenjo-daro.\nThe evidence supporting this is that houses and streets at Mohenjo-daro were found covered with silty clay, which is debris left by flood waters. The discovery of settlements built on top of debris from previous buildings suggests repeated flooding, which eventually impoverished the people and led to the abandonment of the settlement.",

          "model_answer_text": "(a) The site of Harappa was discovered in 1921. The civilisation is also called the Indus Valley Civilisation because some of its important sites, which were excavated first, are located in the valley of the river Indus.\n\n(b) The discovery of the Harappan Civilisation was a significant historical event because it pushed back the history of India by at least a thousand years. Before its discovery, it was believed that Indian history began with the advent of the Aryans. This discovery placed the Indian subcontinent's history at par with the other oldest Bronze Age civilisations of the world.\n\n(c) The term 'Bronze Age Civilisation' refers to civilisations that emerged after man learned the art of mixing copper with tin or zinc to produce the alloy called bronze. Bronze is harder and more durable than copper, making it more suitable for manufacturing tools and weapons. Because of the importance of this metal in the growth of the first civilisations, they are known by this name.\nTwo other contemporary Bronze Age civilisations were the Mesopotamian Civilisation and the Egyptian Civilisation.",

Two types of buildings located on the Citadel were the Great Bath and the granary.\n\n(b) Three features of the Granaries at Harappa are:\n1. They were built on a raised platform to protect them from floods.\n2. At Harappa, there were two rows of six granaries each.\n3. The granary had ventilation to prevent grains from becoming mildewed. Working floors for threshing grain and barracks for labourers were found nearby.\n\n(c) The Citadel and Granaries reveal the following:\n1. **Social Hierarchy:** The division of the city into a raised Citadel for the ruling class and a lower town for common people suggests a clear social hierarchy.\n2. **Organised Administration:** The construction of massive structures like the Citadel and large public granaries implies the existence of a well-organized administration or ruling class that could plan, collect taxes or tribute in the form of grain, and mobilize a large labour force.\n3. **Economic Planning:** The Granaries indicate a prosperous and organized agricultural economy. Storing surplus grain suggests a system for managing food resources, possibly for public distribution during famines, for paying wages, or for trade.",

The entrances were usually from narrow lanes rather than the main roads.\n\n(c) The main features of the street layout and drainage system were:\n**Street Layout:** The main streets followed a grid pattern, running from north to south or from east to west. The streets crossed the main road at right angles, dividing the city into square or rectangular blocks. Houses at street corners were rounded to allow carts to pass easily.\n**Drainage System:** This was a unique feature of the civilisation. House drains emptied all waste water into the street drains. There was a network of brick-lined sewage channels throughout the cities. This indicates a high level of planning for sanitation.",

Raikes, how did earthquakes contribute to the decline of Mohenjo-daro? [2]\n(b) Explain the 'Increased Aridity' theory proposed by D.P. Agarwal and Sood. [4]\n(c) Mortimer Wheeler suggested that an attack was a cause for the decline. Explain this theory and the evidence cited. How could 'Deforestation' have also led to the decline? [4]",
          "model_answer_text": "(a) According to hydrologist R.L. Raikes, earthquakes might have raised the level of the flood plains of the Indus river. This uplift blocked the passage of the river to the sea, causing the river's water levels to rise and inundate the hinterland of Mohenjo-daro, leading to its decline.\n\n(b) The 'Increased Aridity' theory, proposed by D.P. Agarwal and Sood, suggests that the civilisation declined due to increasing aridity and the drying up of the river Ghaggar. They argue that tectonic disturbances caused the Sutlej to be captured by the Indus and the Yamuna to shift east to join the Ganges. This left the Ghaggar waterless, leading to ecological disturbance and the subsequent decline of Harappan culture in that region.\n\n(c) Mortimer Wheeler believed that the Aryans destroyed the Indus settlements. The evidence cited is the discovery of skeletons of 13 males and females and one child found lying in a room in the last phase of Mohenjo-daro, suggesting they were massacred in the streets and houses.\n'Deforestation' could have led to decline because enormous quantities of wood were needed to produce bronze, bake bricks and pottery, and build boats and furniture. This large-scale consumption of wood could have led to deforestation, resulting in climatic change in the region.",

Town planners had studied tides to allow ships to enter the port at high tide, and the dockyard was scientifically designed to withstand water flow and had a water-locking system.\n3. **Trading Centre:** The presence of a warehouse next to the dockyard indicates that it was a major trading and manufacturing centre, facilitating the movement of goods.\n4. **Coastal Route:** It suggests the existence of a coastal trade route linking various Harappan sites like Dholavira and Sutkagendor.",

His eyes are half-closed, suggesting a state of meditation. Due to these features, some scholars believe that this is the statue of a yogi or a priest. The sculpture is of high artistic value and points to the existence of skilled artisans.\n\n(c) Harappan seals provide the following information:\n**Religion:** The Pashupati seal, showing a three-faced deity seated cross-legged and surrounded by animals, suggests that the people believed in a deity identified as Pashupati Mahadeva (Shiva). The unicorn seal shows their mythical beliefs.\n**Trade:** The seals were used for commercial purposes. Traders would stamp their goods by pressing the seal on a layer of wet clay applied to the knot of a bag. An intact seal at the destination indicated that the goods were not tampered with and also conveyed the identity of the sender. The discovery of these seals in different regions indicates that Harappan trade was spread over a vast area.",

[4]\n(c) Explain the 'Indigenous Origin' theory. What evidence from pre-Harappan sites supports this theory? [4]",
          "model_answer_text": "(a) It is called the 'Harappan Civilisation' after the name of the first major site discovered, Harappa, in 1921.\nIt is also known as the 'Indus Valley Civilisation' because some of its important sites, which were excavated first, are located in the valley of the river Indus.\n\n(b) The discovery of the Harappan Civilisation is significant for two main reasons:\n1. **Pushed Back History:** Before its discovery, it was believed that the history of India began with the advent of the Aryans. The discovery pushed back the history of India by at least a thousand years.\n2. **Parity with other Ancient Civilisations:** It placed the ancient history of India at par with the other oldest Bronze Age civilisations of the world, namely the Mesopotamian and Egyptian Civilisations. It showed that India had an advanced urban civilisation at a very early period.\n\n(c) The 'Indigenous Origin' theory states that the Harappan Civilisation was not of foreign origin but was an outgrowth of the extensive local village cultures of the Indian soil. It evolved from these pre-existing agricultural communities.\nEvidence supporting this theory comes from similarities between pre-Harappan and proto-Harappan cultures at sites like Kot Diji, Amri, and Kalibangan. These similarities include the presence of granaries, defensive walls, and evidence of long-distance trade, suggesting a gradual evolution into the mature Harappan phase.",

The Mesopotamian Civilisation, on the banks of rivers Euphrates and Tigris.\n2. The Chinese Civilisation, in the valley of Hwang Ho and Yangtze rivers.\n3.

          "model_answer_text": "(a) Other than Harappa, granaries have been found at Mohenjo-daro, Lothal, and Kalibangan.\n\n(b) Three important features of the granaries at Harappa are:\n1. **Structure:** There were two rows of six granaries each. \n2. **Associated Structures:** To the south of the granaries were working floors with circular brick platforms for threshing grain. Two-roomed barracks, possibly for labourers, were also found.\n3. **Protective Measures:** The granary was built on a raised platform to protect it from floods and had ventilation to prevent grains from becoming mildewed.\n\n(c) The existence of granaries indicates the following about Harappan economy and society:\n1. **Agricultural Surplus:** The large size of the granaries suggests that the Harappans produced a surplus of food grains like wheat and barley, which could be stored for future use, trade, or during emergencies.\n2. **Organised State/Ruling Class:** The construction and maintenance of such large public structures imply an organised and efficient administrative system, possibly a ruling class that collected grains as taxes from the farmers.\n3. **Urban Sustenance:** These stored grains likely sustained the urban population, including artisans, traders, and administrators who were not directly involved in farming.\n4. **Trade and Transport:** The location of the Harappa granary near the river Ravi suggests that food grains were a key part of their trade and were transported by boat.",

Explain this statement with reference to its heritage in any three different fields. [4]",
          "model_answer_text": "(a) Two main features of the Harappan script are:\n1. It is pictographic, as its signs represent birds, fish, and varieties of the human form.\n2. It was written from right to left.\n\n(b) The evidence that suggests many people were literate is the availability of the script on a wide variety of objects. The script has been found inscribed on a number of seals, copper tools, rims of jars, copper and terracotta tablets, jewellery, and even on an ancient signboard. This widespread use implies that the ability to read and write was not limited to a small class of scribes but was probably more common among the population.\n\n(c) The statement is correct. Many features of the Harappan civilisation were found in later cultural developments. Its heritage can be seen in:\n1. **Technology and Crafts:** The Harappan way of making baked pottery, bricks, beads, jewellery, and textiles was adopted by later civilisations.\n2. **Agriculture:** One of the most remarkable achievements was the cultivation of cotton, a practice which was later adopted by the Egyptians.\n3. **Religion:** In the religious sphere, the worship of Pashupati Shiva, the female deity as Mother Goddess, sacred trees, animals, and religious symbols continued and are prevalent in some form even today.",

Before its discovery, it was believed that the history of India began with the advent of the Aryans. The discovery pushed back the history of India by at least a thousand years. It also put India's ancient history at par with the other oldest Bronze Age civilisations of the world, namely the Mesopotamian and Egyptian Civilisations.\n\n(c) The four Bronze Age civilisations that emerged around 2500 BC were:\n1.  The Harappan Civilisation in India and Pakistan.\n2.  The Mesopotamian Civilisation on the banks of rivers Euphrates and Tigris.\n3.

If the bag reached its destination with its seal intact, it indicated that it had not been tampered with. It also conveyed the identity of the sender or the owner.\n\n(c) The Pashupati Seal shows a three-faced deity wearing a buffalo-horned head-dress. The deity is seated cross-legged on a throne and is surrounded by an elephant, a tiger, a buffalo, and a rhinoceros, with two deer at his feet. This deity has been identified as Pashupati Mahadeva. Its significance is that it shows that the people probably believed in Shiva, indicating an early form of Shaivism.",

Its massive structure points out that there might have existed a ruling class that could mobilise labour and collect taxes to build such a huge structure for the public. It also signifies the importance of ritual bathing.\n\n(c) The Citadel was the raised area of each Harappan city, built on mud brick platforms.

The main streets followed a grid pattern.\n\n(b) The main streets in Harappan cities followed a grid pattern, running from north to south or from east to west. They crossed the main road at right angles, which had the effect of dividing the city into square or rectangular blocks. The houses at street corners were often rounded to allow carts to pass easily. House drains emptied all waste water into the street drains.\n\n(c) Four features of the residential houses were:\n1. They were built on a high mound to protect them from floods.\n2. They varied in size, from single-room tenements to bigger houses with courtyards and up to twelve rooms.\n3. Each house had covered drains connected with street drains, and many had private wells and toilets.\n4. The houses were made of brick and wood, with doors, windows, and ventilators. Entrances were from narrow lanes, not the main roads.",

          "model_answer_text": "(a) The 'Foreign Origin' theory suggests that the Harappan Civilisation came into existence as a result of a sudden migration of people with an urban civilisation to the Indus basin. According to these scholars, the Harappan Civilisation was an offshoot of the Mesopotamian Civilisation.\n\n(b) The 'Foreign Origin' theory based on trade with Mesopotamia has been rejected on the ground that no evidence of trade with Mesopotamia during the early Harappan period has been found. Furthermore, excavations have indicated striking differences between the Harappan and Mesopotamian Civilisations.\n\n(c) The 'Indigenous Origin' theory states that the roots of the Harappan Civilisation lie deep in the Indian soil. It suggests that the urban Harappan culture was an outgrowth of the extensive local village cultures. This is supported by marked similarities between pre-Harappan and proto-Harappan cultures at sites like Kot Diji, Amri, and Kalibangan in terms of features like granaries, defensive walls, and long-distance trade. Historians concluded that the Harappan Civilisation evolved from these agricultural communities.",

Answer the following questions regarding these theories of decline:\n(a) How might 'Floods and Earthquakes' have caused the decline of Mohenjo-daro? [3]\n(b) Explain the theory of 'Increased Aridity' as a cause for the decline. [3]\n(c) Who proposed the 'Attack' theory and what evidence was cited in its support? How could deforestation have contributed to the decline? [4]",
          "model_answer_text": "(a) It is believed that floods in Mohenjo-daro led to its abandonment. Houses and streets were found covered with silty clay left by flood waters. Some scholars suggest that earthquakes might have raised the level of the flood plains of the Indus river, blocking its passage to the sea. The rising water levels then led to the inundation of Mohenjo-daro's hinterland.\n\n(b) The theory of 'Increased Aridity' suggests that the civilisation declined due to increasing dryness and the drying up of the river Ghaggar. Tectonic disturbances caused the Sutlej to be captured by the Indus and the Yamuna to shift east to join the Ganges, leaving the Ghaggar waterless. This ecological disturbance led to the decline.\n\n(c) The 'Attack' theory was proposed by Mortimer Wheeler, who believed the Aryans destroyed Indus settlements. The evidence cited was the discovery of skeletons of 13 males and females and one child found lying in a room in Mohenjo-daro, suggesting a massacre. Deforestation could have led to climatic change in the region, as enormous quantities of wood were needed to produce bronze, bake bricks and pottery, and make boats, leading to the clearing of forests.",

The seal was then pressed on it, leaving an impression. If the seal was intact when the bag reached its destination, it showed that the goods had not been tampered with. It also conveyed the identity of the sender.\n\n(c) The 'Pashupati Seal' shows a three-faced deity seated cross-legged on a throne, surrounded by animals. This deity is identified as Pashupati Mahadeva, indicating that the people believed in a form of Lord Shiva. The 'Unicorn Seal', depicting a mythical one-horned animal, shows that the Harappans held mythical beliefs.",

The Citadel was a raised area built on mud brick platforms. It contained important buildings like the Great Bath, granaries, and assembly halls, and was likely where the ruling class lived. The lower town was the residential area where the common people lived and worked. The citadel was separated from the lower town by a wall.\n\n(c) Four characteristic features of Harappan houses were:\n1. They were built on high mounds to protect them from floods.\n2. Houses varied in size, from single-room tenements to larger houses with courtyards and up to twelve rooms.\n3. Each house had private wells and toilets, with covered drains connected to street drains.\n4. They were made of brick and wood, and doors and windows opened onto side lanes rather than the main roads.",

          "model_answer_text": "(a) Two theories proposed for the decline are: (i) Floods and Earthquakes, and (ii) Increased Aridity. (Other valid answers: Deforestation, Attack by Aryans).\n\n(b) According to this theory, frequent floods in Mohenjo-daro, evidenced by silty clay covering streets and houses, led people to abandon the settlement. A hydrologist suggested that this was not normal flooding. Earthquakes may have raised the level of the Indus flood plains, blocking the river's path to the sea. This caused the river's water level to rise, leading to the inundation of Mohenjo-daro's hinterland.\n\n(c) Increased Aridity: This theory suggests the civilisation declined due to the drying up of the river Ghaggar. Tectonic disturbances caused its tributaries, the Sutlej and Yamuna, to change course. This left the Ghaggar waterless, leading to a major ecological disturbance. Deforestation: As a Bronze Age culture, the Harappans needed enormous amounts of wood to produce bronze, bake bricks and pottery, and make boats. This large-scale consumption of wood could have led to deforestation, resulting in climatic changes in the region.",

Excavations have revealed striking differences between the Harappan and Mesopotamian Civilisations.\n2. There is no evidence of trade with Mesopotamia during the early Harappan period, which would be expected if it were an offshoot.\n\n(c) The 'Indigenous Origin' theory proposes that the Harappan Civilisation's roots lie deep in the Indian soil and it was an outgrowth of extensive local village cultures. This theory is supported by evidence of marked similarities between pre-Harappan and proto-Harappan cultures (at sites like Kot Diji, Amri, and Kalibangan) and the mature Harappan Civilisation. These similarities include the presence of granaries, defensive walls, and long-distance trade, leading historians to conclude that the civilisation evolved from these local agricultural communities.",

Bronze was harder and more suitable for manufacturing tools and weapons. Two other contemporary Bronze Age civilisations were the Mesopotamian Civilisation and the Egyptian Civilisation.\n\n(c) The discovery of the Harappan Civilisation was historically significant for two main reasons. First, until its discovery, it was believed that the history of India began with the advent of the Aryans. This discovery pushed back the history of India by at least a thousand years. Second, it put India's ancient history on par with the other oldest Bronze Age civilisations of the world, namely those of Mesopotamia and Egypt, demonstrating an equally ancient and advanced urban culture.",

Additionally, seals which can be traced to the Persian Gulf and a structure identified as a warehouse were also found.\n\n(c) The dockyard's existence reveals significant technical knowledge. It shows they had hydraulic knowledge, allowing boats to dock. It indicates they studied tides to enable ships to enter the port. The scientific design to withstand water currents and the presence of a water locking system prove their advanced engineering skills. In terms of trade, it strongly suggests Lothal was a major centre for overseas trade, with commercial contacts with Mesopotamia and other West Asian sites.",

Two distinctive objects of the Harappan culture are seals and baked bricks (or weights, stone blades).\n\n(b) The Harappan script is regarded as pictographic because its signs represent birds, fish, and varieties of the human form. Two of its characteristics are:\n1. It was not alphabetical as it has too many signs (between 375 and 400).\n2. It was written from right to left.\n\n(c) The evidence that literacy may have been widespread is that the script is found inscribed on a wide variety of objects, such as seals, copper tools, rims of jars, copper and terracotta tablets, and jewellery. The major challenge historians face is that the script has not yet been deciphered. This means we do not know what is written, what language it represents, or who the Harappans were.",

What distinctive objects define the 'Harappan Culture' for archaeologists? (3 marks)\n(c) Explain the historical significance of the discovery of the Harappan Civilisation for understanding the history of India. (5 marks)",
          "model_answer_text": "(a) Harappa was discovered in 1921. Two other contemporary Bronze Age civilisations were the Mesopotamian Civilisation and the Egyptian Civilisation.\n\n(b) It is also known as the Indus Valley Civilisation because some of its important sites, which were excavated first, are located in the valley of the river Indus. The distinctive objects that define Harappan Culture are seals, weights, stone blades, and baked bricks.\n\n(c) The discovery of the Harappan Civilisation was historically significant for several reasons. Firstly, it pushed back the history of India by at least a thousand years. Before its discovery, it was believed that Indian history began with the advent of the Aryans. Secondly, it placed the ancient history of India on par with other oldest civilisations of the world, like those of Mesopotamia and Egypt. This established that a highly developed urban civilisation existed in the Indian subcontinent around 2500 BC, contributing significantly to the world's ancient heritage.",

Their common shapes were rectangular or square, though some were circular.\n\n(b) The Pashupati seal suggests that the people believed in a deity identified as Pashupati Mahadeva or Shiva. It shows a three-faced deity seated cross-legged on a throne, surrounded by animals. The Unicorn seal shows their mythical beliefs, as the unicorn is a mythical animal.\n\n(c) The seals were mainly produced for commercial purposes. They were used by traders to stamp their goods. A layer of wet clay was applied on the knot of a tied bag of goods, and the seal was pressed on it. This left an impression which served two purposes. Firstly, if the bag reached its destination with the seal intact, it indicated that the goods had not been tampered with. Secondly, the impression conveyed the identity of the sender or the owner. The discovery of these seals in different regions, like Mesopotamia, indicates that Harappan trade was spread over a vast area.",

(2 marks)\n(b) What arrangements were made for water supply and for people using the bath? (3 marks)\n(c) The Great Bath provides significant information about the Harappan Civilisation. Explain any five points of its significance. (5 marks)",
          "model_answer_text": "(a) The Great Bath has a large rectangular tank. There are two flights of steps, one in the north and the other in the south, leading into the tank. To make it watertight, burnt bricks and mortar lined with bitumen and gypsum were used.\n\n(b) Water for the bath was provided by a well in an adjacent room. Surrounding the bath were porticos and sets of rooms, which scholars believe were either for a priesthood or for people to change their clothes. There was also a stairway leading to an upper storey.\n\n(c) The Great Bath's significance lies in what it reveals: \n1. Advanced Art of Building: Its construction indicates a high degree of perfection in building techniques.\n2. Existence of a Ruling Class: Such a massive structure suggests a ruling class capable of mobilizing labour and collecting taxes for public works.\n3. Efficient Planning: The design shows efficient planning related to water supply and sewage disposal.\n4. Religious Importance: Scholars believe it was used for ritual bathing, indicating the importance of ceremonial purity in their culture.\n5. Standardisation: The use of baked bricks of a standardised size points to meticulous planning and a centralised system.",

(3 marks)\n(c) Explain the evidence that proves the Harappans had commercial contacts with Mesopotamia and other West Asian sites. (5 marks)",
          "model_answer_text": "(a) Centres for bangle-making were Balakot and Chanhudaro. Centres for manufacturing beads were Lothal and Chanhudaro.\n\n(b) The mode of exchange was barter, as they did not use metal money. Two examples of goods traded internally are: rice imported to Punjab from Gujarat, and cotton provided by Lothal and Surkotada to other townships.\n\n(c) Evidence of external trade is strong. The discovery of a dockyard at Lothal suggests overseas trade. Mesopotamian records from 2350 BC refer to trade relations with 'Meluha', the ancient name for the Indus region. These texts also mention intermediate trading stations like Dilmun (Bahrain) and Makan. Mesopotamian texts refer to Meluha as a 'land of seafarers'. Additionally, depictions of ships and boats on Harappan seals indicate sea trade. The discovery of Harappan seals in Mesopotamia and Persian Gulf seals in places like Lothal further confirms these commercial contacts.",

(2 marks)\n(b) Explain the theory of 'Increased Aridity' as a cause for the decline. (3 marks)\n(c) Describe how 'Floods and Earthquakes' could have contributed to the abandonment of settlements like Mohenjo-daro. (5 marks)",
          "model_answer_text": "(a) Mortimer Wheeler proposed the theory of Aryan attacks. He cited the evidence of skeletons of 13 males and females and one child found lying in a room in Mohenjo-daro, suggesting they were massacred.\n\n(b) Historians D.P. Agarwal and Sood suggested that the civilisation declined due to increasing aridity and the drying up of the river Ghaggar. Tectonic disturbances caused its tributaries, Sutlej and Yamuna, to change course. The Sutlej was captured by the Indus, and the Yamuna shifted east to join the Ganges. This left the Ghaggar waterless, leading to ecological disturbance and decline.\n\n(c) Some scholars believe that repeated floods led to the abandonment of Mohenjo-daro. Evidence for this is the silty clay found covering houses and streets. People would rebuild on top of the debris, but eventually, they could not cope and abandoned the site. Hydrologist R.L. Raikes suggested that this was not normal flooding. He proposed that earthquakes might have raised the level of the Indus flood plains, blocking the river's passage to the sea. This would cause the river's water level to rise, leading to the massive inundation of Mohenjo-daro's hinterland.",

Other valid answers include boat-making, making terracotta articles, goldsmithy (jewellery), bead-making, and pottery.\n\n(b) The 'Bearded Man' is a stone sculpture discovered from Mohenjo-daro. The statue has a shawl worn over the left shoulder. Its eyes are half-closed, suggesting a state of meditation. Some scholars believe this is a statue of a yogi or a priest. It is of high artistic value, pointing to the existence of skilled artisans.\n\n(c) The 'Dancing Girl' is a bronze statue from Mohenjo-daro and is considered a masterpiece of art. Its discovery shows a high degree of development in the art of sculpture. The figurine shows vigour and ingenuity. The fact that it is made of bronze, an alloy of copper and tin/zinc, demonstrates their advanced knowledge of metallurgy and the complex process of casting metal, specifically the lost-wax technique (though not explicitly named, implied by 'art of sculpture' and 'bronze'). The posture, with the right arm on the hip and the left arm heavily bangled, shows their skill in capturing realistic and dynamic human forms.",

(3 marks)\n(c) Explain the 'Indigenous Origin' theory, mentioning the evidence that supports it. (5 marks)",
          "model_answer_text": "(a) The 'Foreign Origin' theory suggests that the Harappan Civilisation came into existence due to a sudden migration of people with an urban civilisation to the Indus basin. It is primarily linked to the Mesopotamian Civilisation, suggesting the Harappan Civilisation was an offshoot of it.\n\n(b) The theory has been rejected for two main reasons. Firstly, excavations have indicated striking differences between the Harappan and Mesopotamian Civilisations (e.g., in urban planning, script, seals). Secondly, the idea that trade with Mesopotamia transformed the early Harappan phase to a mature one is rejected because no evidence of such trade during the early Harappan period has been found.\n\n(c) The 'Indigenous Origin' theory posits that the roots of the Harappan Civilisation lie deep in the Indian soil. It suggests that the urban Harappan culture was an outgrowth of the extensive local village cultures that existed in the region. These agricultural communities evolved into the mature urban civilisation. The evidence supporting this theory comes from marked similarities between pre-Harappan and proto-Harappan cultures (at sites like Kot Diji, Amri, Kalibangan) and the mature Harappan phase in terms of features like granaries, defensive walls, and long-distance trade.",

At Harappa, the granary was built on a raised platform to protect it from floods, and it had ventilation to prevent grains from becoming mildewed.\n\n(c) To the south of the granaries at Harappa, working floors with circular brick platforms were discovered. It is believed these were used for threshing grain, as wheat and barley grains were found in the crevices. Two-roomed barracks were also found, which likely accommodated labourers. The location of Harappa near the river Ravi suggests that food grains were brought to this place by boat for processing and storage, indicating an organised system of collection and distribution managed from the city.",

(Other correct answers: worship of sacred trees, animals, serpents, religious symbols).\n\n(b) The Harappan people played games like dice. They also went on hunting and fishing expeditions. Their main musical instruments were the drum and the lyre.\n\n(c) Men wore a dhoti as a lower garment and a shawl as an upper garment. Women wore a skirt and used a cloak to cover their arms and shoulders. The discovery of needles and buttons suggests that some clothes were stitched. Both men and women wore ornaments. These included necklaces, finger-rings, bangles, armlets, and earrings. They were made of gold, silver, precious stones, and ivory.",

[3]\n(c) Explain three ways in which the seals provide information about Harappan trade. [4]",
          "model_answer_text": "(a) The Great Bath was discovered at Mohenjo-daro. To make it watertight, burnt bricks and mortar were used, which were lined with bitumen and gypsum.\n\n(b) The Pashupati Seal depicts a three-faced deity wearing a buffalo-horned head-dress, seated cross-legged on a throne. The deity is surrounded by an elephant, a tiger, a buffalo, and a rhinoceros, with two deer at his feet. Its religious significance is that this deity has been identified as Pashupati Mahadeva, suggesting that the people believed in a form of Shiva.\n\n(c) Seals provide information about Harappan trade in the following ways:\n1.  **Commercial Purpose:** Seals were used by traders to stamp their goods. A layer of wet clay was applied on the knot of a bag of goods, and the seal was pressed on it, leaving an impression.\n2.  **Security and Authenticity:** If a bag reached its destination with its seal intact, it indicated that it had not been tampered with. It also conveyed the identity of the sender or the owner.\n3.  **Vast Trade Network:** Harappan seals have been found in different regions, including Mesopotamia. This indicates that the Harappan trade had spread over a vast area, including overseas trade.",

A common feature of their ground plans was the layout of streets in a grid pattern and the division of the city into blocks of houses.\n\n(b) Each city was divided into two parts: the 'Citadel' and the 'lower town'.\n1.  **The Citadel:** This was a raised area built on mud brick platforms. It contained important buildings like the Great Bath, the granary, the assembly hall, and workshops. It was separated from the lower town by a wall.\n2.  **The Lower Town:** This area had the residential buildings where the people lived and worked.\n\n(c) Four characteristic features of Harappan houses were:\n1.  They were built on a high mound to protect them from floods.\n2.  Houses varied in size, from single rooms to larger houses with courtyards, private wells, and toilets.\n3.  Each house had covered drains connected to the main street drains.\n4.  The houses were made of brick and wood, and doors and windows opened on the side lanes rather than the main roads.",

The 'Bearded Man' was a stone sculpture, and the 'Dancing Girl' was a bronze statue.\n\n(b) The 'Bearded Man' is a stone sculpture of a man with a beard. He is shown wearing a shawl over his left shoulder, and his eyes are half-closed as if in a state of meditation. Some scholars believe this is a statue of a yogi or a priest. It suggests the existence of skilled artisans who could make beautiful three-dimensional figures.\n\n(c) **Weaving:** A piece of woven cotton was discovered from Mohenjo-daro, and textile impressions were found on several objects. The discovery of needles and buttons also suggests that clothes were stitched. This shows weaving was an important craft.\n**Bead-making:** The Harappans knew the art of bead-making. Ornaments like necklaces were made of precious stones. Lothal and Chanhudaro were known centres for the manufacturing of beads. This shows they were skilled in this craft.",

Agarwal and Sood for Increased Aridity).\n\n(b) According to hydrologist R.L. Raikes, earthquakes might have raised the level of the flood plains of the Indus river. This uplift blocked the river's passage to the sea, causing the river's water level to rise and inundate the hinterland of Mohenjo-daro. The evidence supporting flooding is that houses and streets at Mohenjo-daro were found covered with silty clay left by flood waters.\n\n(c) Deforestation could have led to climatic change in the region, contributing to its decline. Wood was needed in enormous quantities for two main reasons:\n1.  **Fuel for Metallurgy and Crafts:** As a Bronze Age culture, wood was needed to produce bronze. It was also required for baking bricks, pottery, and stoneware.\n2.  **Construction:** Wood was needed to make boats and furniture.",

It is called a 'Bronze Age' civilisation because bronze, an alloy of copper and tin/zinc, was the primary metal used for making tools and weapons, and its use was important for the growth of the civilisation.\n\n(b) The discovery of the Harappan Civilisation was historically significant because it pushed back the history of India by at least a thousand years. Before its discovery, it was believed that Indian history began with the advent of the Aryans. This discovery placed the Indian civilisation at par with the other oldest Bronze Age civilisations of the world, namely the Mesopotamian and Egyptian Civilisations.\n\n(c) In archaeology, 'Culture' refers to a group of objects distinctive in style that are usually found together within a specific geographical area and period of time.

It proposes that the urban Harappan culture was an outgrowth of extensive local village cultures. Historians have found similarities between pre-Harappan and proto-Harappan cultures at sites like Kot Diji and Amri in terms of granaries, defensive walls, and long-distance trade, leading to the conclusion that the civilisation evolved from these local agricultural communities.\n\n(c) The Harappan Civilisation arose in the north-western regions of the Indian subcontinent, in what is now India and Pakistan. It extended from Sutkagendor on the Makran coast in the west to parts of Gujarat in the south and northern Rajasthan and Haryana in the east. Important sites are located in the Indus valley as well as outside it. The entire area of the civilisation is triangular in shape and covers about 1.3 million sq. km, making it the largest among ancient civilisations.",

[3]\n(c) Explain four aspects of the Harappan heritage that continued in later Indian culture and civilisation. [4]",
          "model_answer_text": "(a) The Harappan script is pictographic and has not yet been deciphered. It is known to have between 375 and 400 signs. It is believed that the script was written from right to left, as evidenced by some seals showing wider space on the right than the left, suggesting the engraver ran out of space on the left.\n\n(b) The granaries indicate:\n1.  **Agricultural Surplus:** The existence of large granaries suggests that the Harappans produced a surplus of grains like wheat and barley.\n2.  **Organised System:** They had an organised system for storage and possibly tax collection in the form of grain.\n3.  **Labour Management:** The presence of working floors for threshing and barracks for labourers suggests an organised management of labour.\n\n(c) Four aspects of Harappan heritage are:\n1.  **Crafts and Technology:** The Harappan way of making baked pottery, bricks, beads, and jewellery was adopted by later civilisations.\n2.  **Agriculture:** The cultivation of cotton was a remarkable achievement that was adopted by others, like the Egyptians, much later.\n3.  **Religious Worship:** The worship of Pashupati (a prototype of Shiva) and the Mother Goddess has continued in some form in India.\n4.  **Religious Symbols and Practices:** The worship of sacred trees, animals, serpents, and the use of religious symbols are practices that were prevalent in the Harappan period and have continued to this day.",

          "model_answer_text": "(a) Two materials used to make seals were terracotta and steatite. They were usually found in rectangular or square shapes, though some were circular.\n\n(b) The seals provide crucial information about Harappan trade. They were used by traders for commercial purposes to stamp their goods. After a bag of goods was tied, a layer of wet clay was applied to the knot, and the seal was pressed on it. An intact seal at the destination indicated that the goods had not been tampered with. It also conveyed the identity of the sender. The discovery of Harappan seals in different regions like Mesopotamia indicates that trade was spread over a vast area.\n\n(c) The Pashupati Seal depicts a three-faced deity wearing a buffalo-horned head-dress. The deity is seated cross-legged on a throne and is surrounded by an elephant, a tiger, a buffalo, and a rhinoceros, with two deer at his feet. Its religious significance is that scholars have identified this deity as Pashupati Mahadeva, suggesting that the people of the Harappan Civilisation believed in and worshipped a form of Lord Shiva.",

          "model_answer_text": "(a) To make the pool watertight, burnt bricks and mortar were used for construction. The structure was also lined with bitumen and gypsum.\n\n(b) The Great Bath consists of a large rectangular tank in a courtyard. This courtyard is surrounded by a corridor on all four sides. There are two flights of steps, one in the north and the other in the south, leading into the tank. The water was supplied by a well in an adjacent room. Surrounding the bath were porticos and sets of rooms, with a stairway leading to an upper storey.\n\n(c) The massive structure of the Great Bath points out that there might have existed a ruling class that could mobilise labour, collect taxes, and build such a huge structure for the public. Its design, which portrays efficient planning in water supply and sewage disposal, highlights their advanced organisational capabilities. Regarding religious beliefs, most scholars agree that the Great Bath was likely used for religious purposes, such as a ritual or ceremonial bath. This indicates the importance the Harappans attached to ceremonial bathing in sacred tanks, a practice that has continued in India.",

          "model_answer_text": "(a) Some scholars believe that floods in Mohenjo-daro led to its abandonment. Evidence for this is the discovery of houses and streets covered with silty clay left by flood waters. Hydrologist R.L. Raikes suggested that earthquakes might have raised the level of the flood plains of the Indus river. This uplift could have blocked the river's passage to the sea, causing the river's water level to rise and inundate the hinterland of Mohenjo-daro.\n\n(b) According to historians D.P. Agarwal and Sood, the civilisation declined due to increasing aridity and the drying up of the river Ghaggar. Tectonic disturbances caused the Sutlej to be captured by the Indus and the Yamuna to shift east to join the Ganges, leaving the Ghaggar waterless. This ecological disturbance and shift in the drainage pattern is believed to have led to the decline of the Harappan Civilisation.\n\n(c) The theory of an attack by foreigners was proposed by historians like Mortimer Wheeler. He believed that the Aryans destroyed the Indus settlements. The evidence cited is from the last phase of Mohenjo-daro, where skeletons of 13 males and females and one child were found lying in a room, suggesting they were massacred in the streets and houses.",

Further evidence includes the remains of stone anchors, marine shells, and seals which can be traced to the Persian Gulf. A structure identified as a warehouse also suggests that Lothal was a port for trade.\n\n(c) The Harappans had commercial contacts with Mesopotamia. Mesopotamian records from about 2350 BC refer to trade relations with 'Meluha', the ancient name for the Indus region. These texts also mention two intermediate trading stations, Dilmun (Bahrain) and Makan, which lay between Mesopotamia and Meluha. Mesopotamian texts refer to Meluha as a 'land of seafarers', and Harappan seals depicting ships and boats also indicate trade was carried out by sea.",

The discovery pushed back the history of India by at least a thousand years. It also put the ancient Indian civilisation at par with the other oldest Bronze Age civilisations of the world, namely the Mesopotamian and Egyptian Civilisations.\n\n(c) The four major Bronze Age civilisations that emerged by about 2500 BC were:\n1. The Harappan Civilisation in India and Pakistan.\n2. The Mesopotamian Civilisation in modern Iraq.\n3. The Chinese Civilisation in the valley of Hwang Ho and Yangtze rivers.\n4. The Egyptian Civilisation on the banks of the Nile river.",

It shows a man with a beard, wearing a shawl over his left shoulder, with eyes half-closed as if in meditation. Some scholars believe it is a statue of a yogi or a priest.\n\n(b) The statue of the 'Dancing Girl' is a masterpiece of art made of bronze. It was found at Mohenjo-daro. The figurine shows vigour and ingenuity. Her right arm rests on her hip, and her left arm, which is heavily bangled, holds a small bowl against her left leg.\n\n(c) Besides sculpture, the Harappans excelled in many other crafts, including:\n1. Weaving: A piece of woven cotton was discovered from Mohenjo-daro.\n2. Pottery: They produced glossy and shining pottery, crafted on a potter's wheel and decorated with black geometrical designs.\n3. Seal-making and making terracotta articles were also important crafts.",

The Citadel was built on a mud brick platform and contained important public buildings like the Great Bath, the granary, the assembly hall, and workshops. It was also where the ruling class lived. The lower town had the residential buildings where the general populace lived and worked.\n\n(c) Four common elements found in both Mohenjo-daro and Harappa are:\n1. Both were located on river banks.\n2. Both had similar ground plans, including the layout of streets and blocks of houses.\n3.

          "model_answer_text": "(a) The 'foreign origin' theory suggests that the Harappan Civilisation was an offshoot of the Mesopotamian Civilisation and came into existence due to a sudden migration of people. This theory has been rejected because excavations have revealed striking differences between the Harappan and Mesopotamian Civilisations. Furthermore, no evidence of trade with Mesopotamia during the early Harappan period has been found.\n\n(b) The 'indigenous origin' theory posits that the roots of the Harappan Civilisation lie in the Indian soil and that it was an outgrowth of extensive local village cultures. Evidence supporting this theory includes marked similarities between pre-Harappan and proto-Harappan cultures at sites like Kot Diji, Amri, and Kalibangan in terms of features like granaries, defensive walls, and long-distance trade. From this, historians concluded that the Harappan Civilisation evolved from these local agricultural communities.\n\n(c) Three features of the Harappan script are:\n1. It is regarded as pictographic, as its signs represent birds, fish, and varieties of the human form.\n2. It was not alphabetical as it has too many signs, between 375 and 400.\n3. It was written from right to left, as evident from seals showing wider space on the right than on the left.",

Two features of the granaries at Harappa are that they were built on raised platforms to protect them from floods, and they had ventilation to prevent grains from becoming mildewed. Additionally, at Harappa, there were two rows of six granaries each.\n\n(b) In the religious sphere, the Harappan legacy is significant. The worship of Pashupati Shiva, the female deity as Mother Goddess, and the reverence for sacred trees, animals, serpents, and religious symbols were prevalent during the Harappan period. Many of these beliefs and practices have continued in India to this day.\n\n(c) Two other aspects of Harappan life adopted by later civilisations are:\n1. The Harappan way of making baked pottery, bricks, beads, and jewellery.\n2. The cultivation of cotton, which was a remarkable achievement and was adopted by the Egyptians several centuries later.",

It was a large rectangular tank in a courtyard with two flights of steps leading into it.\n2. To make the pool watertight, burnt bricks and mortar lined with bitumen and gypsum were used.\n\n(b) The Great Bath is a significant source of information in the following ways:\n1. Art of Building: It indicates that the art of building had reached a high degree of perfection during the Harappan period.\n2. Existence of a Ruling Class: The massive structure suggests that there was a ruling class capable of mobilising labour and collecting taxes to build such huge structures for public use.\n3. Religious Importance: Most scholars believe it was used for religious purposes, such as ritual bathing, highlighting the importance of ceremonial purity in their culture.\n\n(c) The Citadel was the raised area of each Harappan city, built on mud brick platforms. It contained the houses of the ruling class and other important public buildings. Two important buildings located there, other than the Great Bath, were the granary and the assembly hall/workshops.",

(3 marks)\n(b) Describe the 'Pashupati Seal' and explain its religious significance. (3 marks)\n(c) Besides trade, state two other purposes for which the seals might have been used. What does the Unicorn seal suggest? (4 marks)",
          "model_answer_text": "(a) Two materials used to make Harappan seals were terracotta and steatite. The seals provide information about trade by their use in stamping goods. A seal's impression on a clay knot indicated that the goods had not been tampered with and also conveyed the identity of the sender. The discovery of seals in different regions indicates that Harappan trade was spread over a vast area.\n\n(b) The Pashupati seal depicts a three-faced deity wearing a buffalo-horned head-dress, seated cross-legged on a throne. The deity is surrounded by an elephant, a tiger, a buffalo, and a rhinoceros, with two deer at his feet. Its religious significance is that scholars have identified this deity as Pashupati Mahadeva, suggesting that the Harappans believed in a prototype of the god Shiva.\n\n(c) Besides trade, seals were probably used as amulets, carried by their owners for personal protection or identity, similar to modern-day identity cards. The script on the seals indicates that the Harappans were literate. The Unicorn seal shows their mythical beliefs.",

They shared common ground plans, including the layout of streets and blocks of houses.\n3. Both cities had advanced water supply and drainage systems, including indoor plumbing and brick-lined sewage channels.\n\n(b) Three main characteristics of Harappan town planning were:\n1. Division of the city into two parts: the raised 'Citadel' for important buildings and the 'lower town' for residential purposes.\n2. The streets followed a grid pattern, running from north to south or east to west and crossing each other at right angles.\n3. An elaborate drainage system where house drains emptied waste water into covered street drains.\n\n(c) Four features of Harappan residential houses were:\n1. They were built on a high mound to protect them from floods.\n2. Houses varied in size, from single-room tenements to larger houses with courtyards, private wells, and toilets.\n3. Each house had covered drains connected to the main street drains.\n4. They were made of brick and wood, and doors and windows opened onto side lanes rather than the main roads.",

The two intermediate trading stations mentioned were Dilmun (identified with Bahrain) and Makan.\n\n(c) The dockyard at Lothal was an important trading and manufacturing centre used for carrying out overseas trade. Its discovery suggests that the Harappans possessed advanced hydraulic knowledge and an understanding of tides, as the dockyard was scientifically designed to allow ships to come in at high tide and to withstand water flow. It also had a water locking system. This testifies to their ability to conduct external trade by sea.",

(3 marks)\n(c) Explain the 'Indigenous Origin' theory. What evidence from pre-Harappan sites supports this theory? (4 marks)",
          "model_answer_text": "(a) It is called the 'Harappan Civilisation' after the name of the first major site discovered, Harappa, in 1921. Its discovery is important because it pushed back the history of India by at least a thousand years, putting it at par with other ancient Bronze Age civilisations like Mesopotamia and Egypt. It disproved the earlier belief that Indian history began with the Aryans.\n\n(b) The 'Foreign Origin' theory suggested that the civilisation was an offshoot of the Mesopotamian Civilisation, resulting from a sudden migration of people. This theory was rejected because excavations revealed striking differences between the two civilisations. Also, no evidence of trade with Mesopotamia was found during the early Harappan period, which would have been necessary for such a transfer of culture.\n\n(c) The 'Indigenous Origin' theory states that the urban Harappan culture was an outgrowth of extensive local village cultures in the Indian subcontinent. It evolved from these local agricultural communities. Evidence supporting this includes marked similarities between pre-Harappan and proto-Harappan cultures at sites like Kot Diji and Kalibangan, specifically in terms of features like granaries, defensive walls, and long-distance trade.",

          "question_text": "Several theories have been proposed to explain the decline of the Harappan Civilisation. In this context, answer the following:\n(a) According to hydrologist R.L. Raikes, what natural calamities may have caused the flooding of Mohenjo-daro? (3 marks)\n(b) Explain how increased aridity and ecological disturbances could have led to the civilisation's decline, as suggested by D.P. Agarwal and Sood. (3 marks)\n(c) State Mortimer Wheeler's theory about the destruction of Indus settlements. What archaeological evidence is cited to support his view? (4 marks)",
          "model_answer_text": "(a) According to R.L. Raikes, the flooding was not normal. He suggested that earthquakes might have raised the level of the flood plains of the Indus river. This uplift blocked the river's passage to the sea, causing the river's water level to rise and inundate the hinterland of Mohenjo-daro.\n\n(b) According to D.P. Agarwal and Sood, the decline was caused by increasing aridity and the drying up of the Ghaggar river. They suggest that tectonic disturbances caused its tributaries, the Sutlej and Yamuna, to change course. The Sutlej was captured by the Indus and the Yamuna shifted east to join the Ganges. This left the Ghaggar waterless, causing an ecological disturbance that led to the decline.\n\n(c) Mortimer Wheeler believed that the Aryans attacked and destroyed the Indus settlements. The archaeological evidence cited to support this is the discovery of skeletons of 13 males and females and one child found lying in a room in Mohenjo-daro, suggesting they were massacred in the streets and houses during the last phase of the city.",

Two other important crafts were boat-making and seal-making (or making terracotta articles/pottery).\n\n(c) The 'Bearded Man' is a stone sculpture discovered from Mohenjo-daro. The statue has a shawl worn over the left shoulder, and the eyes are half-closed. This sculpture suggests that there were skilled artisans who could make beautiful three-dimensional figures. The meditative posture suggests that the statue might be of a yogi or a priest, indicating their spiritual or religious beliefs.",

          "model_answer_text": "(a) A 'Bronze Age Civilisation' refers to a civilisation where the alloy bronze, made by mixing copper with tin or zinc, became important for manufacturing tools and weapons. The first metal to be discovered by man was copper.\n\n(b) According to archaeologists, the term 'Culture' is used for a group of objects distinctive in style, usually found together within a specific geographical area and period of time. Two distinctive objects of the Harappan Culture are seals and baked bricks (or weights/stone blades).\n\n(c) Four aspects of the Harappan heritage that continued are:\n1. Technical Skills: The way of making baked pottery, bricks, beads, and jewellery was adopted by later civilisations.\n2. Cultivation of Cotton: This was a remarkable achievement of the Harappans which was later adopted by the Egyptians.\n3. Religious Worship: The worship of Pashupati (a prototype of Shiva) and the Mother Goddess has continued in some form.\n4. Worship of Nature: The worship of sacred trees, animals, and serpents, prevalent in the Harappan period, continues to this day.",

[2]\n(b) Describe the 'Pashupati Seal' and explain its religious significance. [3]\n(c) How do seals provide evidence of Harappan trade? Explain the process of their use in commerce. [5]",
          "model_answer_text": "(a) The materials used for making Harappan seals were terracotta, steatite, and agate. Their most common shape was rectangular or square.\n\n(b) The 'Pashupati Seal' depicts a three-faced deity wearing a buffalo-horned head-dress. The deity is seated cross-legged on a throne and is surrounded by an elephant, a tiger, a buffalo, and a rhinoceros, with two deer at his feet. Its religious significance is that this deity has been identified as Pashupati Mahadeva, suggesting that the people believed in a form of the god Shiva.\n\n(c) Seals provide evidence of Harappan trade primarily through their discovery in distant lands like Mesopotamia. This indicates that Harappan merchants had commercial contacts over a vast area. The process of their use in commerce involved stamping goods to ensure their security and identify their origin. After a bag of goods was tied, a layer of wet clay was applied to the knot. The seal was then pressed onto the clay, leaving its impression. If the bag reached its destination with the seal's impression intact, it signified that the goods had not been tampered with during transit. The unique impression also conveyed the identity of the sender or owner, functioning much like a modern-day trademark or logo.",

[2]\n(b) Explain the significance of the term 'Bronze Age Civilisation'. Name the four major Bronze Age civilisations that emerged around 2500 BC. [4]\n(c) How did the discovery of the Harappan Civilisation change the historical perspective of India's ancient past? [4]",
          "model_answer_text": "(a) The site of Harappa was discovered in 1921. The civilisation is also known as the Indus Valley Civilisation because some of its important sites, which were excavated first, are located in the valley of the river Indus.\n\n(b) The term 'Bronze Age Civilisation' refers to the period in human history when civilisations developed the art of mixing copper with tin or zinc to produce the alloy called Bronze. Bronze was harder and more ductile than copper, making it more suitable for manufacturing tools and weapons, which was crucial for the growth of these early civilisations. The four major Bronze Age civilisations were: (i) The Harappan Civilisation, (ii) The Mesopotamian Civilisation, (iii) The Chinese Civilisation, and (iv) The Egyptian Civilisation.\n\n(c) The discovery of the Harappan Civilisation fundamentally changed the historical perspective of India's ancient past. Prior to its discovery, it was widely believed that the history of India began with the advent of the Aryans. The unearthing of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro pushed back the timeline of Indian history by at least a thousand years. This discovery established that a highly advanced, urban civilisation existed in the Indian subcontinent long before the arrival of the Aryans. It placed India's ancient history on par with the other oldest civilisations of the world, such as those of Mesopotamia and Egypt, demonstrating an indigenous and sophisticated origin of urban life in the region.",

They were built on a high mound to protect them from floods and had deep foundations.\n2. Houses varied in size, from single-room tenements to larger houses with courtyards and up to twelve rooms.\n3. Many houses had private wells and toilets, indicating a high standard of living.\n4. Each house had covered drains connected to the main street drains, showing an advanced sense of sanitation.\n5. The entrances to the houses were from narrow lanes that cut the streets at right angles, and doors and windows generally did not open onto the main roads, likely for privacy and to reduce dust.",

[3]\n(b) What evidence supports the 'Indigenous Origin' theory? [3]\n(c) Explain any four theories that have been proposed for the decline of the Harappan Civilisation. [4]",
          "model_answer_text": "(a) The 'Foreign Origin' theory posits that the Harappan Civilisation was an offshoot of the Mesopotamian Civilisation, resulting from a sudden migration of people to the Indus basin. This theory has been rejected because excavations have revealed striking differences between the Harappan and Mesopotamian civilisations. Additionally, the related idea that trade with Mesopotamia transformed the early Harappan phase has been rejected due to the lack of evidence of such trade during that period.\n\n(b) The 'Indigenous Origin' theory is supported by research showing that the Harappan culture was an outgrowth of extensive local village cultures. Historians have found marked similarities between pre-Harappan and proto-Harappan cultures at sites like Kot Diji, Amri, and Kalibangan. These similarities include the presence of granaries, defensive walls, and long-distance trade, suggesting that the Harappan Civilisation evolved from these earlier agricultural communities.\n\n(c) Four theories for the decline are:\n1.  **Floods and Earthquakes**: Some scholars believe recurring floods, evidenced by silty clay deposits covering streets in Mohenjo-daro, led to its abandonment. This may have been caused by earthquakes raising the level of the Indus flood plains, blocking the river's path to the sea.\n2.  **Increased Aridity**: Historians like D.P. Agarwal and Sood suggest that increasing aridity and the drying up of the Ghaggar river due to tectonic disturbances that shifted its tributaries (Sutlej and Yamuna) caused ecological disturbances that led to the decline.\n3.  **Deforestation**: As a Bronze Age culture, enormous quantities of wood were needed for producing bronze, baking bricks, pottery, and making boats. This large-scale consumption of wood could have led to deforestation, resulting in climatic change in the region.\n4.  **Attack**: Historians like Mortimer Wheeler proposed that Aryan invaders destroyed Indus settlements. This theory is based on the discovery of skeletons of men, women, and children found lying in streets and houses in Mohenjo-daro, suggesting a massacre.",

[3]\n(c) 'The Great Bath is an important source of information'. Justify this statement with five distinct points explaining what it reveals about the Harappan Civilisation. [5]",
          "model_answer_text": "(a) The largest public building at Mohenjo-daro is the Great Bath. To make its tank watertight, burnt bricks and mortar lined with bitumen and gypsum were used.\n\n(b) At Harappa, there were two rows of six granaries each. These were built on raised platforms to protect them from floods and had ventilation to prevent grains from becoming mildewed. The 'working floors' consisted of rows of circular brick platforms and were believed to be used for threshing grain, as wheat and barley grains were found in their crevices. The two-roomed 'barracks' found nearby possibly accommodated the labourers who worked there.\n\n(c) The Great Bath is a significant source of information because:\n1. **Advanced Art of Building**: Its careful construction shows that the art of building had reached a high degree of perfection.\n2. **Existence of a Ruling Class**: The massive structure suggests the existence of a ruling class capable of mobilizing labour, collecting taxes, and undertaking large public works projects.\n3. **Efficient Planning**: The design, with its features for water supply and sewage disposal, portrays efficient urban and structural planning.\n4. **Religious Practices**: Scholars believe it was used for religious purposes, possibly ritual bathing, highlighting the importance of ceremonial purity in their culture, a practice that has continued in India.\n5. **Standardisation**: The use of standardised bricks (sun-dried or baked) indicates a high level of planning and a centralized administration that could enforce such standards across construction projects.",

What does it suggest about the person depicted and the artisans who created it? [3]\n(c) Explain the evidence that suggests weaving, bead-making and pottery were important crafts in the Harappan Civilisation. [5]",
          "model_answer_text": "(a) The statue of the 'Dancing Girl' was made of bronze. It was discovered at Mohenjo-daro.\n\n(b) The 'Bearded Man' is a stone sculpture discovered from Mohenjo-daro. The statue depicts a man with a beard, wearing a shawl over his left shoulder. His eyes are half-closed, suggesting a state of meditation. Some scholars believe this is the statue of a yogi or a priest. The sculpture is of high artistic value, pointing to the existence of skilled artisans who could create beautiful three-dimensional figures.\n\n(c) Evidence for important crafts includes:\n1. **Weaving**: A piece of woven cotton was discovered at Mohenjo-daro. Furthermore, textile impressions were found on several objects. The discovery of needles and buttons suggests that some clothes were stitched. The depiction of a shawl on the 'Bearded Man' also points to textile production.\n2. **Bead-making**: The Harappans knew the art of bead-making, and specific sites like Lothal and Chanhudaro were centres for the manufacturing of beads. Goldsmiths made jewellery, including beads, from silver, gold, and precious stones.\n3. **Pottery**: Harappans produced characteristic glossy and shining pottery. Earthen vessels were crafted on the potter's wheel and decorated with black geometrical designs. The discovery of large jars with narrow necks and red pots with black decoration bears evidence of their artistic skill in pottery.",

With reference to internal and external trade, answer the following:\n(a) By what system did the Harappans carry on exchanges? Name two sites that were centres for bangle-making. [2]\n(b) What evidence has been found at the Lothal dockyard to suggest overseas trade? [3]\n(c) Describe the Harappans' trade relations with Mesopotamia and Central Asia, mentioning key locations and terms. [5]",
          "model_answer_text": "(a) The Harappans did not use metal money and carried on all exchanges through the barter system. Balakot and Chanhudaro were centres for bangle-making.\n\n(b) The discovery of a rectangular dockyard at Lothal in Gujarat is the primary evidence for overseas trade. Supporting evidence includes the discovery of stone anchors, marine shells, and seals which can be traced to the Persian Gulf. Additionally, a structure identified as a warehouse further suggests that Lothal was a port used for commercial activities.\n\n(c) The Harappans had extensive trade relations with Mesopotamia and Central Asia. Mesopotamian records from about 2350 BC refer to trade with 'Meluha', the ancient name for the Indus region, calling it a 'land of seafarers'. These texts mention two intermediate trading stations, Dilmun (identified as Bahrain) and Makan, which lay between Mesopotamia and Meluha. This trade was likely carried out by sea, which is corroborated by depictions of ships and boats on Harappan seals. To facilitate trade with Central Asia, the Harappans had set up a trading colony in northern Afghanistan. They imported materials like gold from Afghanistan and copper from Arabia.",

In this context, answer the following questions:\n(a) What kind of script did the Harappans use? Approximately how many signs does it contain? [2]\n(b) What evidence suggests that the script was written from right to left? [3]\n(c) Although undeciphered, what information does the existence and widespread use of the script provide about the Harappan people? Explain its significance as an archaeological source. [5]",
          "model_answer_text": "(a) The Harappans used a pictographic script, as its signs represent birds, fish, and varieties of the human form. The number of signs is known to be between 375 and 400.\n\n(b) The evidence that the script was written from right to left comes from examining seals. On some seals, there is wider space on the right side and the letters appear cramped on the left. This suggests that the engraver started inscribing from the right and ran out of space as they reached the left-hand side.\n\n(c) Even though it is undeciphered, the script provides valuable information. Firstly, its widespread availability on various objects like seals, copper tools, rims of jars, and tablets indicates that literacy was likely not confined to a small elite, and many people were probably literate. Secondly, the fact that it is not alphabetical (as it has too many signs) tells us about the nature of their writing system. As an archaeological source, its significance is immense but unrealized. If deciphered, it could unlock answers to fundamental questions about the Harappan language, their system of governance, their beliefs, the subject matter of their records, and ultimately, their identity. The fact that the first seal was found in 1875 and we still cannot read it highlights the profound mystery that surrounds this advanced civilisation.",

These were made of materials like gold, silver, precious stones, and ivory.\n\n(c) The main forms of amusement for Harappans were playing games like dice, and going on hunting and fishing expeditions. Their main musical instruments were the drum and the lyre. A variety of toys were also found, including terracotta models of birds, animals, figurines, carts, and whistles. These findings suggest a society that had leisure time and valued recreation for both adults and children. The creation of toys indicates an affection for children and a developed craft industry that catered to non-utilitarian goods.",

With reference to its heritage and key sites, answer the following:\n(a) Name two major Harappan cities now located in Pakistan and two located in India. [2]\n(b) 'The decline of the physical aspects of the Harappan civilisation did not lead to the total disappearance of all the traits of this civilisation.' In light of this statement, describe the Harappan legacy in the religious sphere. [4]\n(c) Apart from religion, explain the Harappan heritage in the fields of (i) agriculture and (ii) crafts that were adopted by later civilisations. [4]",
          "model_answer_text": "(a) Two Harappan cities in Pakistan are Harappa and Mohenjo-daro. Two cities in India are Lothal and Kalibangan (Other valid answers: Banawali, Dholavira).\n\n(b) The statement is true as many religious practices of the Harappans continued into later Indian culture. The worship of Pashupati Shiva, as seen on the seal, is considered a prototype of the Hindu god Shiva. The worship of a female deity, likely a Mother Goddess, is also a tradition that has continued in various forms. Furthermore, the reverence for sacred trees (like the Peepal tree), animals, and serpents, along with the use of religious symbols like the swastika, which were prevalent during the Harappan period, have continued to be a part of religious life in India to this day.\n\n(c) The Harappan heritage in other fields includes:\n(i) **Agriculture**: One of the most remarkable achievements of the Harappan people was the cultivation of cotton. This practice was later adopted by other civilisations, including the Egyptians, after several centuries. The Harappan methods of grain storage in large granaries also provided a model for later societies.\n(ii) **Crafts**: The Harappan way of making high-quality baked pottery, bricks of a standardised size, beads, jewellery, and textiles was adopted and continued by later civilisations in the subcontinent. Their advanced techniques in metallurgy and craftsmanship set a high standard that influenced subsequent artisanal traditions.",

[3]\n(c) The Great Bath at Mohenjo-daro is a testament to the advanced engineering and social organisation of the Harappans. In this context, explain four inferences that can be drawn about the Harappan civilisation from this structure. [4]",
          "model_answer_text": "(a) Materials used for Harappan seals included terracotta, steatite, and agate.\nTwo distinctive features of the seals are:\n1. They are mostly rectangular or square in shape, though some are circular.\n2. The majority of seals have short inscriptions with pictures of animals like the one-horned bull, buffalo, tiger, elephant, and rhinoceros.\n\n(b) **Commercial Significance:** Seals were used by traders to stamp their goods. An intact seal on a package indicated that it had not been tampered with and also conveyed the identity of the sender. This suggests a well-organized system of trade.\n**Religious Significance:** Some seals have religious importance. For example, the Pashupati seal, showing a three-faced deity surrounded by animals, suggests the worship of a deity identified as Pashupati Mahadeva (a proto-Shiva). The Unicorn seal points to their mythical beliefs.\n\n(c) Four inferences that can be drawn from the Great Bath are:\n1. **High Degree of Engineering Skill:** The construction using burnt bricks, mortar, bitumen, and gypsum to make it watertight shows that the art of building had reached a high degree of perfection.\n2. **Existence of a Ruling Class:** The massive structure indicates the presence of a ruling class that could mobilize labour, collect taxes, and organize the construction of such a large public building.\n3. **Efficient Urban Planning:** The design, with its related water supply from a well and sewage disposal system, highlights the Harappans' efficient planning capabilities.\n4. **Religious Importance:** Scholars believe it was used for ritual bathing, indicating the importance of ceremonial purification in their culture, a practice that has continued in India.",

(Also acceptable: Banawali in Haryana, Surkotada in Gujarat)\n\n(b) Three features of Harappan residential houses are:\n1. Houses were built on a high mound for protection from floods and had deep foundations.\n2. Each house had covered drains connected to street drains, showing a concern for sanitation.\n3. Entrances were from narrow lanes, not the main roads, and rooms were often arranged around a central courtyard, indicating a focus on privacy and functionality.\n\n(c) Purpose of Granaries: Granaries were large storehouses used to store surplus food grains, which were likely collected as revenue or for use during emergencies.\nKey Features: They were built on raised platforms to protect them from floods and had ventilation systems to prevent grains from getting mildewed.\n\nThree significant findings in and around the granary complex at Harappa are:\n1. **Working Floors:** Circular brick platforms were found, believed to be used for threshing grain, as wheat and barley grains were discovered in their crevices.\n2. **Labourers' Quarters:** Two-roomed barracks were discovered nearby, which likely housed the labourers who worked at the granaries.\n3. **Strategic Location:** The location near the river Ravi suggests that food grains were transported to the granary by boats, indicating an organized system of collection and transportation.",

Give one reason why this theory has been rejected. [2]\n(b) Explain the 'Indigenous Origin' theory, highlighting the evidence from pre-Harappan sites that supports it. [3]\n(c) Describe the evidence from Mesopotamian records and archaeological findings that point towards the Harappan Civilisation's extensive external trade network. [5]",
          "model_answer_text": "(a) The 'Foreign Origin' theory suggests that the Harappan Civilisation was an offshoot of the Mesopotamian Civilisation, brought to the Indus basin by a sudden migration of people. This theory has been rejected because excavations have revealed striking differences between the two civilisations (e.g., in town planning, script, and seals). Another reason is that there is no evidence of trade with Mesopotamia during the early Harappan period which could have stimulated its growth.\n\n(b) The 'Indigenous Origin' theory posits that the Harappan Civilisation evolved from local, pre-existing agricultural communities in the Indian subcontinent. This theory is supported by evidence from pre-Harappan and proto-Harappan sites like Kot Diji, Amri, and Kalibangan. These sites show marked similarities with mature Harappan culture in terms of features like granaries, defensive walls, and long-distance trade networks, suggesting a gradual evolution rather than a sudden imposition from outside.\n\n(c) Evidence for extensive external trade includes:\n1. **Mesopotamian Records:** Mesopotamian texts from about 2350 BC refer to trade relations with a region called 'Meluha', which is identified as the Indus region. These texts mention Meluha as a 'land of seafarers'.\n2. **Intermediate Trading Stations:** The same Mesopotamian texts refer to two intermediate trading stations, 'Dilmun' (identified as Bahrain) and 'Makan', which lay between Mesopotamia and Meluha.\n3. **Archaeological Finds (Seals):** Harappan seals have been found in Mesopotamian cities, which confirms trade links. These seals were used to stamp goods, and their discovery so far from their origin indicates commercial contact.\n4. **Archaeological Finds (Dockyard):** The discovery of a large, scientifically designed dockyard at Lothal in Gujarat provides physical proof of maritime trade. The discovery of stone anchors, marine shells and seals traceable to the Persian Gulf further strengthens this.\n5. **Trading Colony:** The Harappans had set up a trading colony in northern Afghanistan to facilitate trade with Central Asia.",

[2]\n(b) Explain what the sculpture of the 'Bearded Man' suggests about the religious beliefs and artistic skills of the Harappans. [3]\n(c) How do the findings related to dress, ornaments, and toys provide a glimpse into the social life, aesthetics, and leisure activities of the Harappan people? [5]",
          "model_answer_text": "(a) The two most famous sculptural finds from Mohenjo-daro are:\n1. The statue of the 'Bearded Man' (or Priest-King), made of stone (specifically, steatite).\n2. The statue of the 'Dancing Girl', made of bronze.\n\n(b) The sculpture of the 'Bearded Man' suggests the following:\n1. **Religious Beliefs:** The statue's eyes are half-closed as if in meditation, and some scholars believe it represents a 'yogi' or a 'priest'. This points to the possible existence of a priestly class and the practice of meditation or similar religious disciplines.\n2. **Artistic Skills:** This three-dimensional figure is of high artistic value. It demonstrates the existence of skilled artisans who could create realistic and expressive sculptures, capturing fine details like the beard and the shawl worn over the shoulder.\n\n(c) Findings related to dress, ornaments, and toys provide the following glimpses:\n1. **Dress & Social Life:** The discovery of needles and buttons suggests that clothes were stitched. Depictions show men wearing a dhoti and shawl, and women wearing a skirt and cloak, indicating a developed sense of clothing. This points to a society that was not just utilitarian but also had social norms regarding attire.\n2. **Ornaments & Aesthetics:** Ornaments like necklaces, bangles, and earrings were worn by both men and women. The use of materials like gold, silver, precious stones, and ivory shows a sophisticated aesthetic sense and access to valuable materials through trade. This also indicates social stratification, as not everyone could afford such items.\n3. **Toys & Leisure:** A variety of toys like terracotta carts, whistles, birds, and animals, along with the discovery of dice, show that children played and adults had leisure activities. Hunting, fishing, and musical instruments like the drum and lyre were other forms of amusement. This reveals a society where there was time for recreation beyond subsistence.",

          "question_text": "The decline of the Harappan Civilisation was not caused by a single event but likely a combination of factors. Discuss this with reference to the following:\n(a) Name two distinct theories for the decline of the civilisation, apart from foreign invasion. [2]\n(b) Elaborate on the theory that links the civilisation's decline to 'Increased Aridity' and shifting river courses. [4]\n(c) Some historians, like Mortimer Wheeler, proposed that an 'Attack' by Aryans led to the end of the Indus settlements. What evidence is cited to support this theory, particularly at Mohenjo-daro? [4]",
          "model_answer_text": "(a) Two distinct theories for the decline are:\n1. Floods and Earthquakes: Repeated flooding and tectonic shifts led to the abandonment of settlements like Mohenjo-daro.\n2. Deforestation: Excessive use of wood for fuel and construction led to climate change and environmental degradation.\n\n(b) The 'Increased Aridity' theory, proposed by historians like D.P. Agarwal and Sood, suggests that the Harappan Civilisation declined due to growing dryness and the drying up of the Ghaggar-Hakra river system. It is believed that the Sutlej and Yamuna were once tributaries of the Ghaggar. Due to tectonic disturbances, the Sutlej was captured by the Indus and the Yamuna shifted east to join the Ganges. This catastrophic shift in the drainage pattern would have deprived the Ghaggar of its water, turning a fertile region into a desert. This ecological disturbance would have made agriculture unsustainable, leading to the collapse of the civilisation in that region.\n\n(c) The 'Attack' theory, proposed by Mortimer Wheeler, suggests that the Aryan invasion destroyed Indus cities. The evidence cited for this is primarily from the late phases of Mohenjo-daro:\n1. **Discovery of Skeletons:** A key piece of evidence is the discovery of skeletons of 13 males and females and one child found scattered in a room. This suggests a massacre occurred, where people were killed in the streets and houses rather than being formally buried.\n2. **Context of Violence:** Wheeler interpreted this as evidence of a final massacre, linking it to the arrival of the Aryans, who are described as warlike in the Rigveda. The unceremonious disposal of the bodies implied a violent end to the city's inhabitants at the hands of invaders.",

          "model_answer_text": "(a) The large dockyard was discovered at Lothal. Two types of artefacts found there indicating maritime trade are:\n1. Stone anchors and marine shells.\n2. Seals which can be traced to the Persian Gulf.\n\n(b) The Lothal dockyard demonstrates advanced hydraulic knowledge in the following ways:\n1. **Tidal Study:** Town planners had studied tides to leverage connecting rivers at high tide, allowing ships to enter the port. This shows a sophisticated understanding of marine and riverine systems.\n2. **Scientific Design:** The dockyard was scientifically designed to withstand the flow of water and its current. It was surrounded by a massive brick wall for protection against floods.\n3. **Water-Locking System:** It had a water-locking mechanism to keep the water in the dockyard, allowing ships to remain afloat regardless of the tide level.\n\n(c) The Harappans were master craftsmen, which is evident from their pottery and bead-making.\n**Pottery:** They produced their own characteristic pottery, which was made glossy and shining. The earthen vessels were crafted on a potter's wheel and were often decorated with black geometrical designs. The discovery of large jars with narrow necks and red pots with black decoration are examples of their high artistic skill in this craft.\n**Bead-Making:** The Harappans knew the art of bead-making. Lothal and Chanhudaro were important centers for this craft. They used precious stones to make beads of various shapes and sizes, which were then used in jewellery. This required great skill in cutting, shaping, and polishing hard stones.",

Seals\n2. Weights\n3. Stone blades\n4. Baked bricks\n\n(c) Four aspects of the Harappan heritage that continued are:\n1. **Material Culture:** The Harappan way of making baked pottery, bricks of a standardized size, beads, and jewellery was adopted and continued by later civilisations.\n2. **Agriculture:** The cultivation of cotton was one of the most remarkable achievements of the Harappans, and this practice was later adopted by others, including the Egyptians.\n3. **Religious Worship:** The worship of Pashupati (as a prototype of Shiva) and the female deity as Mother Goddess have parallels in later Hinduism.\n4. **Religious Symbols and Practices:** The worship of sacred trees, animals (like the bull), serpents, and the use of religious symbols like the swastika, which were prevalent in Harappan times, have continued in India to this day.",

[3]\n(c) The urban planning of Mohenjo-daro and Harappa shared several common elements. Explain four such commonalities that point towards a centralized planning authority. [4]",
          "model_answer_text": "(a) The 'Citadel' was the raised area of a Harappan city. It owed its height to buildings constructed on mud brick platforms and was usually separated from the lower town by a wall. Two types of important buildings found on the Citadel were the Great Bath and the Granary. (Also acceptable: Assembly Hall, Workshops).\n\n(b) Two key characteristics of the Harappan script are:\n1. It is pictographic, as its signs represent birds, fish, and varieties of the human form. It is not alphabetical as it has too many signs (375-400).\n2. It was written from right to left. This is inferred from seals where the engraver seems to have started from the right and ran out of space on the left.\nIt remains undeciphered because the inscriptions are very short, there are no bilingual texts (like the Rosetta Stone) to provide a key, and the language it represents is unknown.\n\n(c) Four common elements between Mohenjo-daro and Harappa suggesting centralized planning are:\n1. **Common Layout:** Both cities followed a similar ground plan, with streets laid out in a grid pattern and houses organized in blocks.\n2. **Identical Structures:** Both cities had key structures like a citadel, granaries, and an advanced water supply and drainage system, suggesting a common blueprint.\n3. **Standardized Bricks:** The use of baked bricks of a standardized size across both cities (and the wider civilization) for construction points to centralized regulation of production.\n4. **Advanced Drainage System:** Both cities featured a unique and sophisticated network of indoor plumbing, paved bathrooms, and brick-lined sewage channels, a complex system that would require central planning and maintenance.",

[3]\n(b) Compare the urban planning of Indus cities with that of the Sumerian cities in Mesopotamia. [3]\n(c) Describe the geographical extent of the Harappan Civilisation. Mention its approximate area and shape. [4]",
          "model_answer_text": "(a) It is called a 'Bronze Age Civilisation' because bronze, an alloy of copper and tin/zinc, was the primary metal used for making tools, implements, and weapons. The widespread use of this harder and more ductile metal was crucial to the growth of the civilisation.\nThe 'Chalcolithic Period' was the period when humans used both stone and copper tools. It represents the transition from the Stone Age to the Metal Age, with copper being the first metal discovered.\n\n(b) The urban planning of Indus and Sumerian cities differed significantly:\n1. **Pattern:** Indus cities followed a grid pattern, with main streets running from north to south or east to west, crossing at right angles. In contrast, Sumerian cities developed around a central temple and followed a more irregular, circular pattern.\n2. **Organisation:** The Indus cities were systematically divided into a raised 'Citadel' for important public buildings and a 'lower town' for residential areas. Sumerian city layouts were less formally structured.\n3. **Focus:** Indus planning shows a strong emphasis on civic amenities for the general population, such as sophisticated drainage systems. Sumerian planning was more focused on monumental religious structures like ziggurats.\n\n(c) The Harappan Civilisation was the largest among the ancient civilisations. Its entire area is triangular in shape and covers about 1.3 million square kilometers. It extended from Sutkagendor on the Makran coast in the west to Alamgirpur in Uttar Pradesh in the east, and from Manda in Jammu in the north to Daimabad in Maharashtra in the south. The core areas were in the north-western regions of the Indian subcontinent, encompassing parts of modern-day Pakistan and India (Gujarat, Rajasthan, Haryana, Punjab).",

[2]\n(b) Explain the significance of the Granaries found at Harappan sites, stating three distinct points. [3]\n(c) The construction of the Great Bath provides significant insights into the Harappan Civilisation. In this context, explain what it reveals about: (i) the existence of a ruling class, (ii) the religious beliefs of the people, and (iii) their engineering skills. [5]",
          "model_answer_text": "(a) Two materials used to make the Great Bath watertight were bitumen and gypsum, which were used to line the mortar and burnt bricks.\n\n(b) The significance of the Granaries is as follows:\n1. They were used to store surplus food grains like wheat and barley, which indicates a productive agricultural system.\n2. The presence of working floors for threshing grain and barracks for labourers suggests an organised system for grain processing and storage.\n3. Their construction on raised platforms with ventilation indicates advanced planning to protect grains from floods and prevent them from becoming mildewed, highlighting their importance to the city's economy.\n\n(c) The Great Bath reveals the following about the Harappan Civilisation:\n(i) **Ruling Class:** The massive structure of the Great Bath indicates that a powerful ruling class must have existed. This class could mobilise labour on a large scale, collect taxes to fund the project, and command the resources necessary to build such a huge public structure.\n(ii) **Religious Beliefs:** Most scholars agree that the Great Bath was likely used for religious purposes, specifically for some kind of ritual or ceremonial bathing. This suggests the importance of ritual purity and bathing in their culture, a practice that has continued in the Indian subcontinent.\n(iii) **Engineering Skills:** The construction demonstrates that the art of building and engineering had reached a high degree of perfection. The design shows efficient planning for water supply from a well, a watertight tank using burnt bricks, mortar, bitumen, and gypsum, and features for sewage disposal. The use of standardised bricks further highlights their advanced planning.",

Your answer should focus on (i) the overall city layout, (ii) the street system, and (iii) the division of the city. [5]",
          "model_answer_text": "(a) Two Harappan cities located in present-day India are Lothal (in Gujarat) and Kalibangan (in Rajasthan). Other valid answers include Banawali, Rangpur, Surkotada, Dholavira.\n\n(b) Three common elements between Mohenjo-daro and Harappa are:\n1. Both cities had similar ground plans, including the layout of streets and blocks of houses.\n2. Both possessed advanced water supply and drainage systems, featuring indoor plumbing, paved bathrooms, and brick-lined sewage channels.\n3. Both cities featured large, strategically placed granaries for food storage.\n\n(c) Harappan town planning was highly advanced and distinct from Sumerian cities.\n(i) **Overall City Layout:** Unlike Sumerian cities which developed in a circular pattern around a temple, Indus cities followed a planned grid pattern. This indicates a high degree of central planning and organisation from the outset.\n(ii) **Street System:** The main streets ran in a grid, either from north to south or east to west, crossing each other at right angles. This divided the city into large rectangular or square blocks. A unique feature was that houses at street corners were rounded to allow carts to pass easily.\n(iii) **Division of the City:** Each city was typically divided into two main parts. The first was the 'Citadel', a raised area built on mud-brick platforms, which housed important public buildings like the Great Bath, granaries, and assembly halls, and was likely occupied by the ruling class. The second part was the 'Lower Town', which was the residential area for the common people.",

[2]\n(b) Explain the primary purpose of Harappan seals and the method by which they were used on goods. [3]\n(c) Discuss the evidence that points towards the existence of a well-established system of both external and internal trade during the Harappan Civilisation. [5]",
          "model_answer_text": "(a) Two Harappan coastal towns important for trade were Lothal and Surkotada. Balakot is also a valid answer.\n\n(b) The primary purpose of Harappan seals was commercial. They were used by traders to stamp their goods. The method involved applying a layer of wet clay on the knot of a tied bag of goods. The seal was then pressed onto the clay, leaving its impression. An intact seal at the destination indicated that the goods had not been tampered with and also identified the sender.\n\n(c) Evidence for extensive trade is substantial:\n**External Trade:**\n1. The discovery of a dockyard at Lothal, connected to the Gulf of Cambay, strongly suggests overseas trade.\n2. Mesopotamian records from 2350 BC refer to trade with 'Meluha' (the Indus region) and intermediate stations like 'Dilmun' (Bahrain).\n3. The discovery of Harappan seals in Mesopotamia and Persian Gulf seals in Lothal provides direct evidence of commercial contact.\n4. Depictions of ships and boats on seals also indicate maritime trade.\n**Internal Trade:**\n1. The presence of specialised manufacturing centres indicates trade within the civilisation. For example, Balakot and Chanhudaro were centres for bangle-making, while Lothal and Chanhudaro produced beads. These goods were then traded across the Indus zone.\n2. Raw materials were sourced from different regions and transported to cities. For instance, copper was brought from Rajasthan and gold from North Karnataka, implying a robust internal trade network.",

In this context, answer the following:\n(a) Name the historian who proposed the 'Aryan Attack' theory and mention one piece of archaeological evidence cited to support it. [2]\n(b) According to the 'Increased Aridity' theory, what ecological disturbances led to the drying up of the river Ghaggar? [3]\n(c) Critically examine the theory of 'Deforestation' as a cause for the decline. Explain why wood was essential to the Harappan economy and how its excessive use could have led to climatic change and the civilisation's downfall. [5]",
          "model_answer_text": "(a) The historian who proposed the 'Aryan Attack' theory was Mortimer Wheeler. The archaeological evidence cited is the discovery of skeletons of 13 males, females, and one child found lying massacred in a room in the last phase of Mohenjo-daro.\n\n(b) According to the 'Increased Aridity' theory, the river Ghaggar dried up due to major tectonic disturbances. These disturbances caused its tributaries, the Sutlej and the Yamuna, to change their courses. The Sutlej stream was captured by the Indus river, and the Yamuna shifted east to join the Ganges. This shift in the drainage pattern left the Ghaggar river waterless, leading to increased aridity in the region.\n\n(c) The theory of 'Deforestation' suggests that the Harappans' own activities led to their decline. Wood was essential to their economy for several reasons:\n1.  **Fuel for Metallurgy:** As a Bronze Age culture, they needed enormous quantities of wood as fuel to smelt copper and produce bronze for tools and weapons.\n2.  **Baking:** Wood was required in large amounts for baking millions of bricks for construction, as well as for pottery and stoneware.\n3.  **Construction and Crafts:** It was also used for making boats, furniture, and in jewellery production.\nThe excessive consumption of wood for these activities could have led to widespread deforestation. This environmental degradation would have resulted in climatic change, such as reduced rainfall and increased aridity, altering the landscape. The loss of forests would disrupt the ecological balance, impacting agriculture and making the region less habitable, thus contributing significantly to the decline of the civilisation.",

[2]\n(b) What evidence suggests that weaving was an important craft in the Harappan Civilisation? [3]\n(c) The Harappan artisans were highly skilled. With reference to the statues of the 'Bearded Man' and the 'Dancing Girl', analyse the artistic and technical skills of the Harappan people in sculpture. [5]",
          "model_answer_text": "(a) Both the 'Bearded Man' sculpture and the 'Dancing Girl' statue were discovered at Mohenjo-daro.\n\n(b) Evidence for weaving as an important craft includes:\n1. The discovery of a piece of woven cotton from Mohenjo-daro.\n2. The finding of textile impressions on several objects.\n3. The depiction of a shawl with a specific pattern worn by the 'Bearded Man' statue suggests knowledge of textiles and weaving.\n\n(c) The sculptures of the 'Bearded Man' and the 'Dancing Girl' highlight the advanced artistic and technical skills of the Harappans.\n**The Bearded Man:** This stone sculpture demonstrates high artistic value and the ability to create realistic three-dimensional figures. The detailed carving of the beard, the carefully patterned shawl worn over the left shoulder, and the half-closed eyes suggesting a meditative state, all point to the existence of skilled artisans who could capture subtle human expressions and details in stone.\n**The Dancing Girl:** This bronze statue is considered a masterpiece of art. It showcases a high degree of development in the art of metal sculpture, likely using the lost-wax casting technique. The figurine's pose is naturalistic and full of vigour, with the right arm on the hip and the left arm heavily bangled. This shows the artisans' ability to portray movement and emotion, as well as their mastery over the medium of bronze.",

In this context, answer the following:\n(a) What term do archaeologists use for a group of distinctive objects found together within a specific area and time period? State one example of such an object from the Harappan Civilisation. [2]\n(b) Explain two reasons why the theory of 'Foreign Origin', suggesting the Harappan Civilisation was an offshoot of Mesopotamia, has been rejected. [3]\n(c) Discuss the 'Indigenous Origin' theory. What evidence from pre-Harappan sites like Kot Diji and Kalibangan supports the view that the urban Harappan culture evolved from local village cultures? [5]",
          "model_answer_text": "(a) Archaeologists use the term 'Culture'. An example of a distinctive object from the Harappan Culture is a seal (or weights, stone blades, baked bricks).\n\n(b) The 'Foreign Origin' theory has been rejected for the following reasons:\n1. Excavations have revealed striking differences between the Harappan and Mesopotamian Civilisations in areas like script, pottery, town planning (grid vs. circular), and seals.\n2. The theory that Mesopotamian trade transformed early Harappan culture into its mature phase is rejected because there is no evidence of trade with Mesopotamia during the early Harappan period.\n\n(c) The 'Indigenous Origin' theory posits that the Harappan Civilisation was not imported but was an outgrowth of extensive local village cultures. It suggests the civilisation evolved from these pre-existing agricultural communities, possibly with some external stimulus from trade contacts later on. \nEvidence from pre-Harappan and proto-Harappan sites supports this:\n1.  **Continuity in Settlement Patterns:** Sites like Kot Diji, Amri, and Kalibangan show a gradual evolution from early agricultural settlements to more complex urban forms.\n2.  **Shared Features:** There are marked similarities between these early cultures and the mature Harappan phase. Key features like fortified settlements with defensive walls, the presence of granaries for food storage, and evidence of long-distance trade were already present in these pre-Harappan settlements. \nThis continuity in key urban features suggests that the mature Harappan Civilisation evolved from these indigenous roots rather than appearing suddenly from a foreign source.",

It was typically glossy and shining.\n3. It was often decorated with black geometrical designs on a red background.\n\n(c) The social life of the Harappans can be understood through their dress and ornaments.\n**Dress:** The men wore a lower garment like a dhoti and an upper garment like a shawl, as depicted on pottery and the statue of the 'priest'. Women wore a skirt and used a cloak. The discovery of needles and buttons at some sites is significant as it shows that at least some of their clothes were stitched, indicating a level of sophistication in garment making.\n**Ornaments:** Ornaments were popular and worn by both men and women. They included necklaces, finger-rings, bangles, armlets, and earrings. These were crafted from a variety of materials, ranging from precious metals like gold and silver to precious stones and ivory, indicating social stratification and a taste for adornment.",

[3]\n(c) Explain the significance of the Lothal dockyard as a source of information. What does its discovery and design reveal about the Harappans' trade relations and their scientific knowledge? [5]",
          "model_answer_text": "(a) The large dockyard was discovered at Lothal in Gujarat. It was connected by channels to the Gulf of Cambay.\n\n(b) Although undeciphered, we can infer the following from the script:\n1. It was not alphabetical, as it has too many signs (between 375 and 400).\n2. It was written from right to left, as indicated by the spacing on some seals where the engraver seems to have run out of space on the left side.\n3. The widespread availability of the script on various objects suggests that many people were likely literate.\n\n(c) The Lothal dockyard is highly significant as a source of information.\n**Trade Relations:** Its existence is powerful evidence of overseas trade. The discovery of stone anchors, marine shells, and seals from the Persian Gulf at the site confirms commercial contacts with distant regions like Mesopotamia. It identifies Lothal as a major port and a crucial centre for both internal and external trade, linking the vast Harappan hinterland to international sea routes.\n**Scientific Knowledge:** The dockyard's design reveals the Harappans' advanced hydraulic knowledge and engineering skills. It was scientifically designed to withstand the flow of water and tides. The planners studied tides to allow ships to enter the dock at high tide, and it included a water-locking mechanism to maintain the water level. The construction with baked bricks and a massive protective wall against floods further testifies to their sophisticated planning and technical capabilities.",

          "model_answer_text": "(a) The Chalcolithic Period, also known as the Copper-Stone Age, was the period when man used both stone tools and copper tools simultaneously. It represents the transition from the use of only stone to the use of metals.\n\n(b) The discovery of the Harappan Civilisation was a significant event for several reasons:\n1. It pushed back the beginning of Indian history by at least a thousand years. Before its discovery, it was believed that Indian history began with the advent of the Aryans.\n2. It established that a highly advanced, urban civilisation existed in India contemporary to the great Bronze Age civilisations of Mesopotamia and Egypt.\n3. It revealed a sophisticated and indigenous culture with unique features like town planning, drainage systems, and seals, adding a glorious chapter to India's past.\n\n(c) The Harappan Civilisation left an enduring legacy.\n(i) **Agriculture and Technology:** One of its most remarkable achievements was the cultivation of cotton, which was later adopted by other civilisations like the Egyptians. Their methods of making baked pottery, standardised bricks, beads, and jewellery were also techniques that were passed down and continued in later cultural developments.\n(ii) **Religion:** Many religious practices of the Harappans show a strong continuity. The worship of a male deity identified as Pashupati Shiva and a female deity as the Mother Goddess are seen as precursors to later Hindu deities. Furthermore, the reverence for sacred trees (like the Peepal), animals, serpents, and the use of religious symbols, all prevalent during the Harappan period, have continued to be a part of religious traditions in India to this day.",

The two most common shapes were rectangular and square, though some were also circular.\n\n(c) Harappan seals offer several other insights:\n**As Amulets:** It is believed that besides their commercial use, seals might have been used as amulets. They were possibly carried on the person of their owners, perhaps as a form of identification or for protection, similar to modern-day identity cards or charms.\n**Harappan Script:** The seals are the primary source for the Harappan script. The short inscriptions on thousands of seals show a pictographic script that has not yet been deciphered. They provide all the known characters of this ancient writing system.\n**Artistic Skills:** The seals are miniature masterpieces that showcase the remarkable artistic skills of the Harappan people. The realistic and detailed engravings of animals like the one-horned bull (unicorn), tiger, and elephant, executed on a very small surface, demonstrate a high degree of craftsmanship and artistic sensibility.",

          "question_text": "With reference to the sources of the Harappan Civilisation and its eventual decline, answer the following questions:\n\n(a) The Harappan seals are a significant archaeological source. In this context, name one material commonly used to make seals and state two features of the Pashupati seal that provide information about Harappan religious beliefs. [3]\n\n(b) Explain the significance of the dockyard discovered at Lothal as evidence of the Harappan trade network. [3]\n\n(c) The decline of this great urban civilisation has been attributed to several factors. Explain any two of the following causes for its decline:\n    (i) Floods and Earthquakes\n    (ii) Deforestation\n    (iii) Foreign Attack [4]",
          "model_answer_text": "(a) One material commonly used to make Harappan seals was steatite (terracotta or agate are also acceptable).\nTwo features of the Pashupati seal that suggest religious beliefs are:\n1. The seal depicts a three-faced deity seated cross-legged on a throne, in a posture of meditation, similar to a yogi. This deity has been identified as a prototype of Lord Shiva (Pashupati Mahadeva).\n2. The deity is shown wearing a buffalo-horned head-dress and is surrounded by animals (an elephant, a tiger, a buffalo, and a rhinoceros, with two deer at his feet), signifying his role as the 'Lord of Animals' or Pashupati.\n\n(b) The discovery of a dockyard at Lothal is highly significant for understanding the Harappan trade network for the following reasons:\n1. It confirms the existence of overseas trade. The dockyard, connected by channels to the Gulf of Cambay, strongly suggests that Lothal was a major port for carrying out maritime trade with contemporary civilisations like Mesopotamia.\n2. It is supported by other archaeological finds at Lothal, such as stone anchors, marine shells, and seals traceable to the Persian Gulf, which substantiates commercial links with West Asian sites.\n3. The scientific design of the dockyard, built to withstand tides and including a water-locking system, testifies to the advanced hydraulic knowledge and engineering skills of the Harappans, which were essential for a thriving maritime trade.\n\n(c) Explanations for two causes of the decline of the Harappan Civilisation are as follows:\n\n(i) Floods and Earthquakes: Some scholars believe that repeated floods led to the decline. Evidence from Mohenjo-daro shows that houses and streets were covered with silty clay from flood waters. A related theory by hydrologist R.L. Raikes suggests that tectonic activities or earthquakes may have raised the level of the Indus flood plains. This geological uplift could have blocked the river's passage to the sea, causing massive and prolonged inundation of the city and its hinterland, eventually forcing its abandonment.\n\n(ii) Deforestation: The Harappan Civilisation was a Bronze Age culture that required enormous quantities of wood as fuel for smelting metal ores to produce bronze. Wood was also essential for baking bricks, pottery, and stoneware, as well as for making boats and furniture. This large-scale consumption of wood could have led to widespread deforestation, resulting in ecological imbalance and climatic changes, such as increased aridity, which would have made the region unsustainable for a large urban population.\n\n(iii) Foreign Attack: Historian Mortimer Wheeler proposed the theory that the Harappan Civilisation was destroyed by Aryan invaders. His argument is based on archaeological evidence found in the last phase of Mohenjo-daro, where skeletons of 13 males, females, and one child were discovered lying in a room and on the streets. Wheeler interpreted this as evidence of a violent massacre of the inhabitants, leading to the collapse of the city and the civilisation.",

It is a large rectangular tank in a courtyard surrounded by a corridor on all four sides.\n2. There are two flights of steps, one in the north and one in the south, leading into the tank. To make it watertight, burnt bricks and mortar lined with bitumen and gypsum were used.\n\n(b) The stone sculpture of the 'Bearded Man' has a shawl worn over the left shoulder. The eyes of the statue are half-closed, suggesting a state of meditation. Some scholars believe it is the statue of a yogi or a priest. It is of high artistic value, indicating the presence of skilled artisans capable of making three-dimensional figures.\n\n(c) The Great Bath is a significant source of information for the following reasons:\n1.  **Art of Building:** Its construction indicates that the art of building had reached a high degree of perfection.\n2.  **Existence of a Ruling Class:** The massive structure suggests the existence of a ruling class that could mobilise labour, collect taxes, and build such structures for the public.\n3.  **Efficient Planning:** The design, including features for water supply and sewage disposal, portrays efficient planning.\n4.  **Religious Purposes:** Most scholars agree it was used for religious purposes, highlighting the importance of ceremonial bathing in their culture.",

Both had common ground plans, including the layout of streets and blocks of houses.\n2. Both cities had advanced water supply and drainage systems, including indoor plumbing, paved bathrooms, and brick-lined sewage channels.\n\n(b) Each city was divided into two parts: the raised area called the 'Citadel' and the 'lower town'. The Citadel was built on mud brick platforms and contained important buildings like the Great Bath and granaries. The lower town had residential buildings. The main streets followed a grid pattern, running from north to south or east to west. They crossed the main road at right angles, dividing the city into square or rectangular blocks.\n\n(c) Three features of Harappan residential houses are:\n1. **Planning and Protection:** Houses were built on a high mound to protect them from floods and had deep foundations. They ranged from single-room tenements to larger houses with courtyards and up to twelve rooms.\n2. **Amenities:** Each house had private wells and toilets. They also had covered drains that were connected to the main street drains.\n3. **Construction and Design:** Houses were made of brick and wood. The entrances were from narrow lanes, and doors and windows opened on the side of the streets, not on the main roads. The kitchen was typically in a sheltered corner of the courtyard.",

          "model_answer_text": "(a) Two materials used to make seals were terracotta and steatite. Their common shapes were rectangular or square, though some were circular.\n\n(b) The Pashupati Seal depicts a three-faced deity wearing a buffalo-horned head-dress. The deity is shown seated cross-legged on a throne. It is surrounded by an elephant, a tiger, a buffalo, and a rhinoceros, with two deer at its feet. This deity is identified as Pashupati Mahadeva, suggesting the worship of a deity akin to Shiva.\n\n(c) Seals are useful in four main ways:\n1.  **Trade:** Seals were used for commercial purposes to stamp goods. An intact seal on a package indicated that it had not been tampered with and also conveyed the identity of the sender. The discovery of seals in different regions indicates the vast area of Harappan trade.\n2.  **Religion and Beliefs:** The Pashupati seal suggests the worship of Shiva. The unicorn seal shows their mythical beliefs.\n3.  **Script:** The seals bear inscriptions in a script that has not yet been deciphered. They are the primary source for understanding the Harappan script, which is pictographic.\n4.  **Amulets/Identity:** Seals may have been used as amulets, carried by their owners, possibly serving a function similar to modern-day identity cards.",

The texts also mention two intermediate trading stations, Dilmun (Bahrain) and Makan, which lay between Mesopotamia and Meluha. Furthermore, Mesopotamian texts refer to Meluha as a 'land of seafarers', which corroborates evidence of maritime trade.\n\n(c) The Harappans had considerable internal trade in stone, metal, and shell, which was carried on through a barter system. Different centres specialised in specific products for wide distribution.\n1.  **Lothal and Surkotada:** Provided cotton for other townships.\n2.  **Balakot and Chanhudaro:** Were centres for bangle-making.\n3.  **Lothal and Chanhudaro:** Were also centres for the manufacturing of beads.\n4.  **Punjab (from Gujarat):** Rice seems to have been imported to Punjab from Gujarat.",

Regarding its decline and origins, answer the following:\n(a) Briefly state the 'Indigenous Origin' theory for the Harappan Civilisation.\n(b) State two reasons why the theory that the Harappan Civilisation was an offshoot of the Mesopotamian Civilisation has been rejected.\n(c) Explain any three causes that may have led to the decline of the Harappan Civilisation.",
          "model_answer_text": "(a) The 'Indigenous Origin' theory suggests that the Harappan Civilisation's roots lie deep in the Indian soil. According to this view, the urban Harappan culture was an outgrowth of extensive local village cultures. Historians have found similarities between pre-Harappan and proto-Harappan cultures at sites like Kot Diji and Amri in terms of granaries, defensive walls, and long-distance trade, suggesting the civilisation evolved from these local agricultural communities.\n\n(b) The 'Foreign Origin' theory, suggesting it was an offshoot of Mesopotamian Civilisation, is rejected for two main reasons:\n1. Excavations have revealed striking differences between the Harappan and Mesopotamian civilisations.\n2. The idea that trade with Mesopotamia transformed the early phase to the mature phase is rejected because no evidence of trade with Mesopotamia during the early Harappan period has been found.\n\n(c) Three possible causes for the decline are:\n1.  **Floods and Earthquakes:** Evidence of silty clay covering houses and streets in Mohenjo-daro suggests recurrent, devastating floods. Some hydrologists believe earthquakes might have raised the flood plains of the Indus, blocking the river's passage to the sea and causing large-scale inundation.\n2.  **Increased Aridity:** Some historians believe the decline was due to increasing aridity and the drying up of the Ghaggar river. Tectonic disturbances may have caused its tributaries, the Sutlej and Yamuna, to change course, leading to ecological disturbance and desertification.\n3.  **Attack:** Historian Mortimer Wheeler suggested that Aryan invaders destroyed Indus settlements. This is based on evidence from the last phase of Mohenjo-daro where skeletons of men, women, and children were found massacred in streets and houses.",

          "model_answer_text": "(a) The discovery of a piece of woven cotton from Mohenjo-daro and textile impressions found on several objects suggest that weaving was an important craft. Two other important crafts were seal-making and making terracotta articles.\n\n(b) Ornaments were worn by both men and women. Common ornaments included necklaces, finger-rings, bangles, armlets, anklets, nose rings, fan-shaped head-dresses and earrings. They were made of a variety of materials including gold, silver, precious stones, and ivory.\n\n(c) The Harappan Civilisation left a significant legacy for later cultures in India:\n1.  **Crafts and Technology:** The Harappan way of making baked pottery, bricks, beads, and jewellery was adopted by later civilisations.\n2.  **Cultivation of Cotton:** One of their most remarkable achievements was the cultivation of cotton, a practice which was adopted by the Egyptians much later and became central to the subcontinent's agriculture and textile production.\n3.  **Religious Worship:** The worship of Pashupati Shiva and the female deity as Mother Goddess, which were prevalent in the Harappan period, have continued in some form in Hinduism to this day.\n4.  **Symbolic and Animal Worship:** The veneration of sacred trees, animals, serpents, and the use of religious symbols (like the swastika, though not explicitly mentioned in the text but implied by 'religious symbols') also have parallels in later Indian religious traditions.",

          "model_answer_text": "The claim of maritime trade between Mesopotamia and 'Meluha' (the Indus region) is substantiated by Harappan seals and the Lothal dockyard in the following ways:\n1.  **Purpose of Seals:** Harappan seals were primarily used for commercial purposes. Traders would press the seal onto a wet clay tag on a tied bag of goods. An intact seal at the destination, such as Mesopotamia, would guarantee that the goods had not been tampered with and would also identify the sender. The discovery of these seals in Mesopotamia is direct physical evidence of Harappan goods reaching there, confirming a trade link.\n2.  **Lothal Dockyard:** The discovery of a scientifically designed dockyard at Lothal, connected by channels to the Gulf of Cambay, proves that the Harappans had the necessary infrastructure and hydraulic knowledge for overseas trade. The text explicitly states Mesopotamian texts refer to Meluha as a 'land of seafarers' and the dockyard at Lothal provides the archaeological proof of this maritime capability, serving as the port from which goods (stamped with seals) would have been shipped to destinations like Mesopotamia.",

          "model_answer_text": "Three large-scale activities that would have required enormous quantities of wood, supporting the deforestation theory, are:\n1.  **Baking of Bricks:** The Harappans used standardised baked bricks extensively in almost all constructions, including houses, city walls, the Great Bath, granaries, and the vast network of drains. Baking millions of bricks for entire cities would require a colossal amount of wood as fuel for the kilns. This continuous, large-scale demand would lead to the clearing of forests.\n2.  **Metallurgy (Bronze Production):** The civilisation is a Bronze Age culture. Smelting copper and mixing it with tin to produce bronze requires very high temperatures, which were achieved by burning large quantities of wood or charcoal (derived from wood). The production of tools, weapons, vessels, and sculptures like the 'Dancing Girl' for a widespread population would necessitate a constant and massive supply of wood fuel.\n3.  **Boat and Furniture Making:** As a civilisation engaged in extensive riverine and maritime trade (as evidenced by the Lothal dockyard and seals found abroad), the Harappans would have needed to construct numerous boats and ships. This, along with making furniture and structural elements for houses, was a significant craft that directly consumed large timber resources, contributing to deforestation over centuries.",

          "model_answer_text": "Two arguments from Harappan urban planning that counter the 'Foreign Origin' theory are:\n1.  **Grid Pattern Layout:** The most striking feature of Harappan cities like Mohenjo-daro and Harappa is their sophisticated grid pattern, with main streets running north-south and east-west, intersecting at right angles. This indicates a high level of central planning from the city's inception. This is in stark contrast to Mesopotamian (Sumerian) cities, which grew organically around temples and followed a circular, irregular pattern. This fundamental difference in urban design philosophy suggests an independent, indigenous development rather than a cultural borrowing or offshoot.\n2.  **Advanced Sanitation and Drainage System:** The Harappans possessed a highly advanced and unique system of water supply and sanitation. Features like indoor plumbing, paved bathrooms, covered brick-lined drains in the streets, and private wells in houses were common. This network of sewage channels is described as 'something unique to the Harappan Civilisation'. The absence of such a comprehensive, city-wide sanitation system in Mesopotamia from the same period strongly indicates that this was an indigenous innovation, not an import from a foreign culture.",

          "model_answer_text": "The Citadel and the 'Dancing Girl' statue provide evidence for a stratified society with at least two different social groups:\n1.  **The Citadel and the Ruling Class:** Each Harappan city was divided into a raised 'Citadel' and a 'lower town'. The Citadel contained important public buildings like the Great Bath and granaries, and explicitly, the 'houses of the ruling class'. The sheer scale of these public works and the physical separation and elevation of this area from the residential lower town strongly implies the existence of a powerful ruling class. This class had the authority to plan cities, collect taxes, and mobilize labour for monumental construction, thus occupying the top tier of the social hierarchy.\n2.  **The 'Dancing Girl' and Skilled Artisans:** The bronze statue of the 'Dancing Girl' found at Mohenjo-daro is described as a 'masterpiece of art' showing a 'high degree of development in the art of sculpture'. The creation of such a sophisticated and artistically valuable object using the complex lost-wax bronze casting technique points to the existence of a class of highly skilled, specialized artisans. These craftsmen, along with goldsmiths, seal-makers, and bead-makers, would have formed another distinct social group, valued for their skills but likely separate from and serving the needs of the ruling and merchant classes.",

Analyse the significance of these two sources in revealing the nature and extent of Harappan trade.",
          "model_answer_text": "(a) Two distinctive objects used to identify the Harappan Culture are weights, stone blades, and baked bricks. (Any two)\n\n(b) The existence of a ruling class is suggested by the massive structure of the Great Bath, which indicates that there must have been a powerful authority capable of mobilising labour, collecting taxes, and commissioning such a large public project. The high degree of planning is evident from its meticulous construction: it was made watertight using burnt bricks, mortar, bitumen, and gypsum. Furthermore, there was an efficient system for water supply from an adjacent well and for sewage disposal, showcasing advanced structural planning.\n\n(c) The dockyard at Lothal is significant evidence of overseas trade. Its scientific design, with features like a massive brick wall for flood protection, channels connecting to the Gulf of Cambay, and a water-locking system, proves the Harappans possessed advanced hydraulic knowledge and engaged in maritime activities. It served as a major port for trade with Mesopotamia and other West Asian sites. The seals are significant because their impressions on goods served as a guarantee of authenticity and ownership, indicating an organised commercial system. The discovery of Harappan seals in regions like Mesopotamia, and finds like Persian Gulf seals at Lothal, confirms that trade was not just internal but had spread over a vast external area, connecting the Harappan Civilisation with other major Bronze Age civilisations.",

          "question_text": "The end of the Harappan Civilisation was likely not caused by a single event but a combination of factors. In this context, answer the following:\n(a) State the theory proposed by Mortimer Wheeler regarding the decline of the civilisation. Mention the evidence he cited.\n(b) Explain how deforestation could have been a significant contributing cause to the decline of the Harappan Civilisation.\n(c) Analyse the 'Increased Aridity' theory. How could geological and hydrological changes involving the rivers Ghaggar, Sutlej, and Yamuna have led to a major ecological disturbance and the eventual decline of Harappan settlements?",
          "model_answer_text": "(a) Mortimer Wheeler believed that the Aryans attacked and destroyed the Indus settlements. The evidence he cited was the discovery of skeletons of 13 males and females and one child found lying massacred in a room in the last phase of Mohenjo-daro.\n\n(b) As a Bronze Age culture, the Harappans required enormous quantities of wood as fuel to smelt metal ores and produce bronze tools and weapons. Wood was also essential for other activities like baking bricks and pottery, making boats, and for construction. This extensive use of wood would have led to large-scale deforestation. Deforestation, in turn, could have resulted in climatic changes in the region, such as reduced rainfall and increased aridity, disrupting agriculture and making the area less habitable, thus contributing to the civilisation's decline.\n\n(c) The 'Increased Aridity' theory, proposed by D.P. Agarwal and Sood, suggests the civilisation declined due to the drying up of the river Ghaggar. Originally, the Sutlej and Yamuna rivers were tributaries of the Ghaggar, making its valley fertile and densely populated. However, due to tectonic disturbances or shifts, the Sutlej was 'captured' by the Indus river system, and the Yamuna shifted its course eastwards to join the Ganges. This shift in the drainage pattern left the Ghaggar river waterless. The loss of such a major river system would have caused a massive ecological disturbance, leading to desertification, agricultural failure, and the forced abandonment of settlements in that region, triggering the decline of the civilisation.",

Based on the map and your knowledge of Harappan trade, what was the primary cause for the development of site 'X' as a major commercial hub?\n\n(a) Its proximity to the fertile plains of the Ravi river, making it a major grain collection and distribution point.\n(b) Its strategic coastal location on the Gulf of Cambay, which facilitated maritime trade with distant civilisations like Mesopotamia.\n(c) Its role as the exclusive centre for manufacturing seals and weights, which were then exported to all other Harappan cities.\n(d) Its discovery of large copper and tin deposits, making it the primary centre for bronze tool production.",

This geographical position was ideal for maritime activities. Archaeological evidence, such as the discovery of a large dockyard, seals of Persian Gulf origin, and stone anchors, confirms that Lothal served as a major port for overseas trade with contemporary civilisations like Mesopotamia (referred to as Meluha in their texts). The other options are incorrect; Harappa was near the Ravi, Lothal was not the exclusive manufacturing centre for seals, and its primary importance was trade, not metal deposits.",

Mesopotamian cities, like Ur, typically grew organically around a central temple complex (ziggurat), resulting in an irregular street pattern. In contrast, Harappan cities like Mohenjo-daro display remarkable planning with streets laid out in a grid pattern, dividing the city into rectangular blocks, and having a distinct raised citadel and a lower town. This striking difference argues against the theory that the Harappan Civilisation was a direct offshoot of Mesopotamia and instead points towards a unique, indigenous evolution of urban planning.",

Its construction indicates a high degree of perfection in the art of building. To make the tank watertight, they used burnt bricks, mortar, bitumen, and gypsum, which demonstrates their advanced planning and engineering skills related to water supply and structural durability.\n\n(iii) The existence of such a massive structure suggests that there was a powerful ruling class that could mobilise labour and collect taxes to construct such a huge public building.

Describe two of its typical features mentioned in the text.\n(ii) What does this particular type of seal suggest about the beliefs of the Harappans? What does the writing on it tell us about their script?\n(iii) Explain the primary commercial purpose of such seals. Why are objects like these considered distinctive to the 'Harappan Culture' by archaeologists?",
          "model_answer_text": "(i) The object shown is a Harappan seal, specifically the Unicorn Seal. Two of its features are the picture of a one-horned animal (unicorn) and a short inscription in the Harappan script. The seals are also typically square or rectangular and made of materials like steatite or terracotta.\n(ii) The Unicorn Seal suggests that the Harappans had mythical beliefs. The writing on the seal shows that the Harappans used a script that has not yet been deciphered. The script is regarded as pictographic as its signs represent birds, fish, and varieties of the human form.\n(iii) The primary commercial purpose of the seals was for traders to stamp their goods. A seal was pressed on a wet clay layer applied to the knot of a bag of goods. If the seal's impression was intact upon arrival, it showed the goods had not been tampered with and identified the sender. Archaeologists consider objects like seals distinctive to the 'Harappan Culture' because the term 'Culture' is used for a group of objects with a distinctive style found together within a specific geographical area and time period. For the Harappans, these distinctive objects include seals, weights, stone blades, and baked bricks.",

Two-roomed barracks were also found nearby, which likely accommodated the labourers who worked there.\n\n(iii) The existence of large granaries indicates that the Harappans had a highly developed agricultural system that produced a surplus of food grains. This suggests a sophisticated economy. The scale and organisation of these structures, often located in the Citadel, point towards a strong, centralised administrative system or a ruling class capable of collecting taxes (likely in the form of grain), storing it for the population, and managing a large labour force.

They would press the seal on wet clay on a knotted bag of goods, leaving an impression. This conveyed the identity of the sender and ensured the goods were not tampered with.\n2.  **Script:** The seals bear inscriptions in the Harappan script.

They were typically made of materials like steatite, terracotta, or agate.\n\n(ii) The main commercial purpose of seals was for traders to stamp their goods. A layer of wet clay was applied to the knot on a bag of goods, and the seal was pressed on it. This impression, if intact upon arrival, showed that the goods had not been tampered with and also identified the sender. This specific seal, the unicorn seal, shows the mythical beliefs of the Harappan people.\n\n(iii) Archaeologists use the term 'Culture' for a group of distinctive objects found together in a specific area and time. For the Harappan Culture, seals are one of these distinctive objects, along with weights, stone blades, and baked bricks, thus helping to define it. The discovery of Harappan seals in different regions, such as Mesopotamia, indicates that the Harappan trade network had spread over a vast area, suggesting the existence of overseas trade.",

To make it watertight, burnt bricks and mortar were used, lined with bitumen and gypsum.\n(iii) The Great Bath provides the following insights into the Harappan civilisation:\n1. **Advanced Building Skills:** The construction and design show that the art of building and efficient planning had reached a high degree of perfection.\n2. **Organised Governance:** The massive structure suggests the existence of a ruling class that could mobilise labour, collect taxes, and build such huge structures for the public.\n3. **Importance of Religion/Ritual:** Its likely use for ceremonial bathing indicates the importance the Harappans attached to religious rituals and cleanliness.",

          "model_answer_text": "(i) The structure shown is the Great Bath at Mohenjo-daro. Two architectural features that ensured it was watertight were the use of burnt bricks and mortar, and the lining of the tank with bitumen and gypsum.\n\n(ii) Scholars believe its primary purpose was for religious or ritual bathing. Its existence signifies that the 'art of building' had reached a high degree of perfection. The massive scale, efficient planning for water supply and disposal, and sophisticated waterproofing techniques demonstrate advanced engineering skills and meticulous execution by the Harappan people.\n\n(iii) The construction of a massive, technologically advanced public structure like the Great Bath required immense resources, planning, and mobilisation of labour. This implies the existence of a powerful central authority or a 'ruling class' that could collect taxes and command such a project. Its location on the Citadel, the administrative and religious centre of the city, reinforces this idea. The structure's probable use for public religious ceremonies indicates a well-organised social and religious life. This level of monumental architecture, urban planning, and social organisation is a key characteristic of the great Bronze Age civilisations like Mesopotamia and Egypt, thus justifying the Harappan Civilisation's status as a contemporary urban power.",

The iconography, featuring a deity identified as Pashupati Mahadeva in a yogic, cross-legged posture and surrounded by animals native to the subcontinent, points to religious traditions and beliefs that are deeply rooted in the Indian soil.

The process involved tying a bag of goods, applying a layer of wet clay over the knot, and then pressing the seal onto the clay. This left an impression which, if found intact at the destination, indicated that the goods had not been tampered with and also identified the sender.\n\n(iii) Before its discovery in 1921, it was believed that Indian history began with the advent of the Aryans. The discovery of the Harappan Civilisation pushed back the timeline of Indian history by at least a thousand years, proving the existence of a highly advanced, older civilisation.

It was discovered at Mohenjo-daro.\n\n(ii) The first interpretation relates to the individual's role in society: some scholars believe it is the statue of a yogi or a priest, evidenced by the half-closed eyes suggesting a state of meditation. This points towards a social structure with religious or priestly figures of importance. The second interpretation relates to craftsmanship: the sculpture is considered to be of high artistic value. It demonstrates the existence of skilled artisans in the Harappan Civilisation who were capable of making detailed, three-dimensional figures.\n\n(iii) The 'Foreign Origin' theory suggests that the Harappan Civilisation was an offshoot of the Mesopotamian Civilisation. However, the 'Indigenous Origin' theory posits that the civilisation evolved from extensive local village cultures. A sophisticated artifact like the 'Bearded Man' supports the indigenous theory for the following reasons: \n1. Its unique artistic style, such as the depiction of a figure in meditation with a patterned shawl, is distinctive and not a mere copy of Mesopotamian art. \n2. The high degree of skill points to a mature, well-developed artistic tradition that must have evolved over a considerable period locally. Such advanced craftsmanship is characteristic of a primary civilisation, not a derivative culture or offshoot. This provides evidence against the idea of a 'sudden migration' of an urban culture and supports the view that Harappan culture grew from deep roots within the Indian soil.",

Explain how this artefact serves as evidence for this classification, and state the major consequence this had on the established chronology of Indian history.",
          "model_answer_text": "(i) The artefact is the bronze statue of a dancing girl. Its right arm rests on the hip and the left arm is heavily bangled. It is made of bronze.\n\n(ii) The artefact reveals significant technological and artistic advancement. Technologically, the ability to create the alloy bronze by mixing copper with tin or zinc, and then casting it into a detailed figure, shows a mastery of metallurgy. Artistically, the statue is described as a 'masterpiece of art' that shows 'vigour, variety and ingenuity', indicating a high degree of development in the art of sculpture and the presence of skilled artisans.\n\n(iii) The artefact serves as direct evidence for the classification of the Harappan Civilisation as a Bronze Age Civilisation because it is made of bronze. This shows that the people had moved beyond the use of just stone and copper, and had learned to produce this harder, more versatile alloy. The major consequence of this discovery was that it pushed back the history of India by at least a thousand years. Before the discovery of the Harappan Civilisation, it was believed that Indian history began with the advent of the Aryans. This discovery placed the Indus Valley Civilisation on par with other great Bronze Age civilisations like those of Mesopotamia and Egypt.",

Describe two construction features that made it a marvel of engineering. [3]\n(ii) Explain the purpose of this structure and the specific knowledge its builders must have possessed to ensure its functionality. [3]\n(iii) Analyse the significance of this site in understanding the Harappan economy. How does evidence from this location, when considered alongside the debate on the civilisation's origins, challenge the theory of it being an 'offshoot of the Mesopotamian Civilisation'? [4]",
          "model_answer_text": "(i) The image shows the dockyard discovered at Lothal in Gujarat. Two construction features that made it an engineering marvel were: it was surrounded by a massive baked brick wall, likely for flood protection, and it was scientifically designed with channels connecting it to the Gulf of Cambay, a water locking system, and an understanding of tides to allow ships to enter.\n\n(ii) The primary purpose of the dockyard was to facilitate overseas trade by allowing ships to load and unload goods. The builders possessed advanced hydraulic knowledge, as shown by their ability to design a structure that could withstand water currents and leverage tides for ships to dock. They also demonstrated efficient planning in connecting the dock to the Gulf of Cambay through channels.\n\n(iii) The dockyard at Lothal is highly significant as it provides concrete evidence of a flourishing and well-established overseas trade network in the Harappan economy, which was not solely agrarian. It proves that Lothal was a major trading and manufacturing centre. The discovery of seals traceable to the Persian Gulf at this site confirms external trade relations. This evidence challenges the 'foreign origin' theory because such a scientifically advanced and massive structure, unique in its design, demonstrates a high degree of indigenous engineering and planning capabilities. Rather than being a mere offshoot, it indicates that the Harappan Civilisation was a distinct, highly developed Bronze Age civilisation that engaged in trade with Mesopotamia as an equal, not as a derivative culture.",
