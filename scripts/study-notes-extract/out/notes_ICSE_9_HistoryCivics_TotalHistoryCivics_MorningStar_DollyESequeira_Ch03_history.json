It can be obtained by following **tri-ratnas** or **three jewels**:\n(a) **right faith**, (b) **right knowledge**, and (c) **right conduct**.\nThese three jewels inspire a true Jain to have faith in the 24 **Tirthankaras** (literally, those who guide men and women across the river of existence), to acquire knowledge from their sermons and to lead a good life.\n\n(ii) **Karma**: The Jains believe in the **Karma theory** of Hinduism and that one should be responsible for one's own Karma or actions. Good deeds alone liberate a man from the cycle of life and death.\n\n(iii) **Equality**: Mahavira laid stress on equality between men and men as well as between men and women. He preached universal brotherhood. He considered all men equal irrespective of their caste or creed. Mahavira believed that the virtuous deeds could achieve ultimate salvation or **nirvana**. All living beings, from the tiny insect to the highest form of life, should be shown compassion.\n\n[Image: Symbol of Jainism]\n\n(iv) **Eternal soul**: Mahavira believed in the immortality of the soul (**atma**). He said that the body dies but not the soul.\n\n(v) **Salvation**: Like the Hindus, Jains believe in **Moksha (Salvation)** or freedom from the cycle of births and rebirths. This can be achieved only by leading an austere life based on non-violence and self-denial. To attain salvation it is necessary to practise the **tri-ratnas** of right faith, right knowledge, and right action.\n\n(vi) **Belief in Penance**: Jains believed in **penance**. To die of starvation, called **santhara** or **sallekhana** was considered a virtue. Jainism lays so much stress on severe penance that very few people could lead such an austere life. This explains why Jainism had few followers."

These Angas are collectively known as **Dwadashangi**. The foremost of these Angas is **Aacharang Sutra**. Another well known Anga is the **Vyakyha Pragnapti** which is more popularly known as **Bhagavati Sutra**. While the former deals with the code of conduct which a Jain monk is required to follow, the later expounds the Jain doctrines in a comprehensive manner. Based on these Angas, the seers also compiled 12 auxiliary works that came to be known as **Upangas**.\n\nIt is said that these Angas and Upangas were not written for a long time. They were orally passed on by the religious leaders to their pupils.\n\nAccording to famous historian, **R.C. Majumdar**, \"Towards the close of the fourth century BC, a famine in South Bihar led to the exodus of an important section of Jainas, headed by Bhadrabahu, to South India. Those that remained behind in Pataliputra called for a council, in order to revive the knowledge of the Angas. The result was the compilation of the twelve Angas. At another council held at Valabhi in Gujarat in the fifth or sixth century AD, a final collection of the scriptures was made for the first time in Ardhmagadhi Prakrit language\".\n\nThe **Angas** are regarded as the most important part of the Jain doctrines. They discuss religious rites, stages of a householder's life, the vows of chastity, rules of conduct and other features of Jain philosophy."

His father was the chief of a **Kshatriya clan** and his mother **Trishala** belonged to the royal family of **Lichchavis**. Mahavira received his early education in all specialised branches. He is said to have been very brave and to have saved his colleagues from dangers. For these deeds of bravery, he was called **Mahavira**. At the time of his birth, his father’s kingdom was prosperous; so the boy was called **Vardhamana** (Prosperity). He got absorbed in spiritual pursuits from early childhood. He was married to **Yashoda**. This was done in order to divert his attention from asceticism. At the age of thirty, after the death of his parents, Mahavira renounced the world and roamed about as an ascetic practising severe penance for 12 years. He silently endured all the hardships. At last he obtained the supreme knowledge. He subdued his desires and became **Jina** or the conqueror. His followers came to be called **Jinas** or **Jains**—i.e., those who have conquered their desires."
