The term **rock** refers not only to any hard solid matter like granite, but also to soft and loose particles like sand, silt and clay derived from the earth. The earth's crust is made up of various types of rocks that differ from one another in texture, structure, colour, permeability, mode of occurrence and degree of resistance to denudation.\n\nRocks consist of **mineral elements**. Though scientists have identified more than 2000 mineral elements, yet only a few of these are important as constituents of rocks. Distinction must be drawn between **mineral elements** found in the earth's crust and the earth as a whole.\n\nThe most abundant **mineral elements** of the earth, as a whole, are **iron, silicon, magnesium, nickel, sulphur and calcium**. The most abundant mineral elements of the crust are **silicon, aluminium, iron, magnesium, calcium, potassium and sodium**. The earth's crust contains more of silicon and aluminium whereas the earth as a whole contains more of iron, silica and magnesium."

These rocks were formed due to **cooling**, **solidification** and **crystallisation** of hot molten material of the earth known as **magma**, found at great depths in the interior of the earth. The chemical composition of these rocks varies from alumino-silicate minerals like quartz and feldspar to granite and rhyolite collectively known as **Sialic rocks**. Since the igneous rocks were the first to be formed, they are called **primary rocks**. They form the basis of formation of other types of rocks."

They are then deposited as **sediments**. Any exposed rock, due to the various agents of **erosion** may weather and disintegrate. The sediments are deposited over long periods in seas, lakes, streams, etc. Subsequent layers are added and due to their own weight from above, the sediments get **cemented** together to form **sedimentary rocks**. They are **secondary rocks** because they are formed by the solidification of sediments of original igneous, sedimentary or metamorphic parent rocks."

The rocks were once igneous or sedimentary which underwent change through physical or chemical processes. The factors that take part in changing the form of rocks are **temperature** and **pressure**, or both. Since rocks are composed of minerals, they may change their composition and texture under great pressure and temperature."

These rocks were formed due to **cooling**, **solidification** and **crystallisation** of hot molten material of the earth known as **magma** found at great depths in the interior of the earth. The chemical composition of these rocks varies from alumino-silicate minerals like quartz and feldspar to granite and rhyolite collectively known as **Sialic rocks**. Since the igneous rocks were the first to be formed, they are called **primary rocks**. They form the basis of formation of other types of rocks.\n\n### Formation of Sedimentary Rocks\nWhen igneous rocks are exposed on the surface of the earth, they are broken down by **weathering** and carried away by forces of **gradation** like rivers, glaciers and ocean waves. They are then deposited as **sediments**. Any exposed rock, due to the various agents of **erosion** may weather and disintegrate. The sediments are deposited over long periods in seas, lakes, streams, etc. Subsequent layers are added and due to their own weight from above, the sediments get cemented together to form **sedimentary rocks**. They are **secondary rocks** because they are formed by the solidification of sediments of original igneous, sedimentary or metamorphic parent rocks.\n\n### Formation of Metamorphic Rocks\nThe word **Metamorphic** is derived from **'metamorphose'** which means change in form. **Metamorphism** refers to the **alteration** of the composition or structure of a rock by **heat**, **pressure** or other natural agency. The rocks were once igneous or sedimentary which underwent change through physical or chemical processes. The factors that take part in changing the form of rocks are temperature and pressure, or both. Since rocks are composed of minerals, they may change their composition and texture under great pressure and temperature."

The accumulations undergo **lithification** through the processes of evaporation, compaction and cementation as discussed earlier.\n3. Once the loose sediment is transformed into **sedimentary rock**, it is then carried into depressions or on the sea floor further down under the earth. The sedimentary rock may further undergo disintegration and be again recrystallised into igneous rock and then transformed into **metamorphic rock**. It should be remembered that in the course of **metamorphism**, rock changes its form under intense heat and pressure.\n4. In case the rock melts it may again result in the formation of igneous rock. The disintegrated material may again form sedimenta rock. In completing any of these changes, hundreds and thousands of years are involved. In the operation of the rock cycle, the earth is kept young and movements of adjustments specially through horizontal flow or convection currents maintain the balance between various elements of the earth like oceans and continents."
