The lines running east to west, parallel to the Equator, are called **lines of latitude**. The lines running north to south passing through the poles are called **lines of longitude**. The intersection of latitudes and longitudes pinpoints a place on the earth's surface. These criss-crossing lines form a framework known as the **Geographic Grid**.\n\n**Eratosthenes**, a Greek philosopher who first calculated the earth's circumference, devised lines of latitude and longitude to locate places on the earth. This grid on a globe or map serves the same purpose as coordinates on a graph paper, where the x-axis is represented by lines of latitude (horizontal) and the y-axis by lines of longitude (vertical).\n\n[Image: Fig. 2.1.

This avoids confusion from having multiple local times.\n*   **Time Zones**: The Earth is divided into 24 time zones, each covering 15° of longitude.\n*   **Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)**: The time at the Prime Meridian (0° longitude) is used as the universal reference time.\n\n**International Date Line (IDL)**: This is the 180° longitude line, which is diametrically opposite the Prime Meridian. When crossing this line, the date changes, and a day is either gained or lost.\n\n**Eastern and Western Hemisphere**: The Prime Meridian (0°) and the 180° longitude line divide the Earth into the **Eastern Hemisphere** and the **Western Hemisphere**."

      "content_md": "**Using Latitudes and Longitudes to Find Location**\nThe intersection of latitudes and longitudes forms a **Geographic Grid**, which allows us to locate places on a globe or map. By knowing the latitude and longitude of a place, we can pinpoint its exact location. It is common practice to write the latitude first, then the longitude.\n*   Example 1: New York – Latitude 41°N and Longitude 74°W\n*   Example 2: New Delhi – 30°N and 77°E\n*   Example 3: Mumbai – 19°N and 73°E\n\n**Calculation of Time**\nThe Earth rotates 360° in 24 hours. Therefore:\n*   15° of longitude corresponds to a time difference of 1 hour.\n*   1° of longitude corresponds to a time difference of 4 minutes.\n\nA helpful mnemonic is the **EGA-WLS formula**: **E**ast-**G**ain-**A**dd and **W**est-**L**ose-**S**ubtract. For each 1° longitude moved towards the East, 4 minutes are added to the time. For each 1° moved towards the West, 4 minutes are subtracted.\n\n**Worked Out Example:**\nIt is 5.30 p.m. in India when the Prime Minister's radio broadcast made from Montreal in Canada was heard. What must have been the time at Montreal?\n*   **Solution 1**: Montreal lies at 74°W. India's standard time is based on 82½°E.\n    *   India is 5 hrs 30 min ahead of GMT. So, when it's 1730 hrs in India, it's 1200 hrs (noon) at Greenwich.\n    *   Montreal's time difference from GMT = 74 × 4 min = 296 min = 4 hours 56 minutes.\n    *   Since Montreal is west of GMT, its time is behind GMT: 12 hrs - 4 hours 56 min = 7:04 a.m.\n*   **Solution 2**: \n    *   Standard Meridian of India = 82½°E\n    *   Standard Meridian of Montreal = 74°W\n    *   Total meridians = 82½° + 74° = 156½°\n    *   Time difference = 156½° × 4 minutes = 626 minutes = 10 hrs 26 minutes.\n    *   Montreal is to the west of India, so time will be deducted: 1730 hrs – 1026 hrs = 7.04 a.m. in Montreal."

      "content_md": "A **great circle** is a circle drawn on the surface of a sphere (such as the earth) that has a radius equal to the radius of the sphere, and whose centre is also the sphere's centre. A plane passing through the center of the earth divides it into two equal parts, and its intersection with the surface forms a great circle.\n\nThe **Equator** is the only line of latitude that is a great circle. A pair of diametrically opposite **longitudes** (e.g., 0° and 180°) also forms a great circle.\n\n**Uses of Great Circles:**\n1.  **Shortest Distance**: Navigators use great circles to find the shortest distance between any two points on the earth's surface. A **Great Circle Route** is the shortest distance between two places and lies on the arc of a great circle.\n2.  **Global Routes**: Great Circle routes are particularly important for long-distance travel for places on opposite sides of the globe, such as routes across the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans.\n3.  **Meteorology**: Great circles are used by meteorologists to determine climate and weather conditions in a region."

Since it is diametrically opposite to the Greenwich Meridian, it causes a time difference of a full day on crossing the line. The time difference works out to 12 hours (180° × 4 min) from either side. Thus, on crossing the line, a day is gained or lost.\n\nWhen crossing from the east, time will be 12 hours ahead, and while crossing from the west, time will be 12 hours behind. For example, if it is 8 PM Monday, 25th December at Greenwich, it will be 8 AM Tuesday, 26th December on crossing the 180° line from the west. But if one travels from the east, it will be 8 AM Monday, 25th December. The difference between these two times is a full 24 hours.\n\nThe **International Date Line (IDL)** is the 180° line. When crossing this date line, the date changes. When sailing eastwards (e.g., Boat 1 in Fig 2.6), Sunday becomes Monday, so a day is lost. When sailing westwards (e.g., Boat 2), Monday becomes Sunday, so a day is gained.\n\nTo avoid the confusion of having different dates within the same country, the **Date Line bends and goes zig-zag** at the Bering Strait between Siberia and Alaska and at Fiji, Tonga, New Zealand, and some other islands.\n\n[Image: Fig. 2.6.
