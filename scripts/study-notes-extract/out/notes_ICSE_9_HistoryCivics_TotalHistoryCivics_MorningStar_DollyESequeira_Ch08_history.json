The **Sultan** was the supreme executive, legislative, judicial and military authority. The Sultan kept an eye on revenue and expenditure. He was assisted by a number of ministers. The key figure in administration was the **wazir**, who acted as the Prime Minister. The wazir supervised the work of the other officials. The final decisions were always taken by the Sultan.\n\nThe minister in charge of the army was called **‘ariz-i-mumalik’**. The ariz was not the commander-in-chief of the army, since the Sultan himself commanded all the armed forces. The special responsibility of the ariz’s department was to recruit, equip and pay the army.\n\nThere were two other important departments, namely, the **diwan-i-risalat** and the **diwan-i-insha**. The **diwan-i-risalat** dealt with religious matters and was presided over by the **Chief Sadar**, who was generally a leading **qazi**. The **qazi** was the head of the department of justice and advised the Sultan on civil and religious matters. The **diwan-i-insha** dealt with state correspondence.\n\nDuring the Sultanate the empire was divided into provinces called **‘iqtas’**. Each province was placed under officials called **‘muqtis’**. To facilitate local administration, provinces were further divided into **‘shiqs’**, and **‘parganas’** or districts. The village was the lowest administrative unit. The officials who worked at the village level included the **‘muqaddam’** (the village headman), the **‘patwari’** (the record-keeper) and the **‘mushrif’** (the village accountant). Each village also had a **panchayat** to settle local disputes.\n\n**Nobles**: The nobles formed an extremely powerful group as they held positions of provincial governors and military commanders.\n\nDuring this period, the practice of giving grants of revenue from a territory came to be known as the **‘iqta system’**. Those who were given iqtas were called **‘iqtadars’**. Out of this grant, the iqtadars had to maintain themselves, their families and some soldiers for use by the Sultan during war. When the central authority became weak, many of these iqtadars functioned as independent rulers of the territories under their command."
