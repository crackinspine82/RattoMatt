        "content_md": "*ORIGIN OF THE ARYANS\n\nThe origin of the Aryans as well as the background of the people who settled in India is full of controversies. Some historians believe that Aryans were the natives of India. Others like Bal Gangadhar Tilak, after the study of Rig Veda and Zend Avesta, concluded that the original home of the Aryans was the Arctic region. A.C. Das, a historian tried to prove that the original home of the Aryans was India. According to him, they lived in the Sapta Sindhu (Punjab) and migrated to other parts of India. Swami Dayanand Saraswati believed that Tibet was the home of the Aryans.\n\nProfessor Max Mueller, the German scholar, believed that the Aryans came to India from Central Asia. He gave two reasons in support of this theory. The first wave of migrations from the Steppes, Central Asia had started around 1500BC. The Aryans bore strong resemblance to bands of warlike people of Central Asia. The Central Asian theory holds the origin of Romans, Celts, Indians, Greeks and Persians from the same stock.\n\nMany historians agree with the Central Asian Theory of Max Mueller. Their reasons for accepting the theory are:\n1. In ancient times, the land in Asia Minor was fertile which made it suitable for agriculture and domestication of animals.\n2. The stone inscriptions discovered in Asia Minor prove that the Aryan gods like Indra and Varuna, were worshipped in ancient times.\n3. The flora and fauna and objects referred to in the Rig Veda were found in Asia Minor.\n4. Asia Minor is equidistance from Europe and India.\n5. Biologists noticed the genetic traits (DNA) of the Steppe people of Central Asia and found similar traits in 35 per cent of the people in north India. Thus, they concluded that the Indo-Aryans migrated from Central Asia to India.\n\nHowever, the issue of the origin of the Aryans is still being disputed.\n\n* This is additional information."

The rich people and businessmen conducted bigger sacrifices. During such yajnas **purohits** received gold, expensive clothes and large number of cows as gifts (**Dakshina**). Giving dakshina was also a ritual and a pious duty. Ritualism gained strong roots and even a small deviation while performing certain worship was considered a sin.\n\nThe **Brahmins** were responsible for bringing about many innovations and evolving new doctrines. More emphasis was laid on penance called **tapasya** which became ritualistic. The new doctrines included the doctrine of **karma** (action), **dharma** (duty) and **moksha** (salvation). The belief in **rebirth** gained roots. Consequently, all these innovations strengthened the position of Brahmins. The Brahmins were said to have divine powers.

Some historians believe that Aryans were the natives of India. Others like Bal Gangadhar Tilak, after the study of Rig Veda and Zend Avesta, concluded that the original home of the Aryans was the Arctic region. A.C. Das, a historian tried to prove that the original home of the Aryans was India. According to him, they lived in the Sapta Sindhu (Punjab) and migrated to other parts of India. Swami Dayanand Saraswati believed that Tibet was the home of the Aryans.\n\nProfessor Max Mueller, the German scholar, believed that the Aryans came to India from Central Asia. He gave two reasons in support of this theory. The first wave of migrations from the Steppes, Central Asia had started around 1500BC. The Aryans bore strong resemblance to bands of warlike people of Central Asia. The Central Asian theory holds the origin of Romans, Celts, Indians, Greeks and Persians from the same stock.\n\nMany historians agree with the Central Asian Theory of Max Mueller. Their reasons for accepting the theory are:\n1. In ancient times, the land in Asia Minor was fertile which made it suitable for agriculture and domestication of animals.\n2. The stone inscriptions discovered in Asia Minor prove that the Aryan gods like Indra and Varuna, were worshipped in ancient times.\n3. The flora and fauna and objects referred to in the Rig Veda were found in Asia Minor.\n4. Asia Minor is equidistance from Europe and India.\n5. Biologists noticed the genetic traits (DNA) of the Steppe people of Central Asia and found similar traits in 35 per cent of the people in north India. Thus, they concluded that the Indo-Aryans migrated from Central Asia to India.\n\nHowever, the issue of the origin of the Aryans is still being disputed.\n\n* This is additional information."
