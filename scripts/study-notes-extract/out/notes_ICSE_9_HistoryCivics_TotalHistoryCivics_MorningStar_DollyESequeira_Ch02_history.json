Others like **Bal Gangadhar Tilak**, after the study of **Rig Veda** and **Zend Avesta**, concluded that the original home of the **Aryans** was the **Arctic region**. **A.C. Das**, a historian tried to prove that the original home of the **Aryans** was India. According to him, they lived in the **Sapta Sindhu** (Punjab) and migrated to other parts of India. **Swami Dayanand Saraswati** believed that **Tibet** was the home of the **Aryans**.\n\n**Professor Max Mueller**, the German scholar, believed that the **Aryans** came to India from **Central Asia**. He gave two reasons in support of this theory. The first wave of migrations from the **Steppes**, **Central Asia** had started around 1500 BC. The **Aryans** bore strong resemblance to bands of warlike people of Central Asia. The **Central Asian theory** holds the origin of Romans, Celts, Indians, Greeks and Persians from the same stock.\n\nMany historians agree with the **Central Asian Theory** of **Max Mueller**. Their reasons for accepting the theory are:\n1. In ancient times, the land in **Asia Minor** was fertile which made it suitable for agriculture and domestication of animals.\n2. The stone inscriptions discovered in **Asia Minor** prove that the Aryan gods like **Indra** and **Varuna**, were worshipped in ancient times.\n3. The flora and fauna and objects referred to in the **Rig Veda** were found in **Asia Minor**.\n4. **Asia Minor** is equidistant from Europe and India.\n5. Biologists noticed the genetic traits (DNA) of the **Steppe** people of **Central Asia** and found similar traits in 35 per cent of the people in north India. Thus, they concluded that the **Indo-Aryans** migrated from **Central Asia** to India.\n\nHowever, the issue of the origin of the **Aryans** is still being disputed."

As a householder, he was to take responsibility of maintaining his family. This period lasted from the age of 25 to 50 years.\n*   The third stage was **Vanaprastha Ashrama**. It lasted from the age of 50 to 75 years. During this period man was expected to retire from worldly life and acquire spiritual and philosophical knowledge.\n*   The last stage lasting from the age of 75 to 100 years was the **Sanyasa Ashrama**. This was the period of renunciation. Man had to leave everything forever and go into meditation in order to attain **moksha** or salvation."

Both archaeological and literary sources depict the introduction of **rice** as the staple diet of the people. The Vedic texts mention **Vrihi**, **Tandula** and **Sali**, denoting rice. The Later Vedic texts also refer to oxen yoked to the plough, suggesting the prevalence of plough cultivation. Towards the end of this period iron ploughshares and metal tools were used and a variety of crops were cultivated.\n\nThe craftsmen mentioned in the Vedic texts include leather workers (**charmakaras**), wheelwrights (**rathakaras**), blacksmiths and potters (**kulala**), and carpenters (**taksan**).
