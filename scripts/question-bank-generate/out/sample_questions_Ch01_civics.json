The text explicitly states that the Constitution was 'adopted and passed by the Constituent Assembly on November 26, 1949,' and that 'only the clauses relating to citizenship and some others came into force immediately.' It further confirms that 'The Constitution as a whole came into force with effect from January 26, 1950.' Reason (R) is factually incorrect. The text clarifies that the 'Objectives Resolution' was passed on 'January 22, 1947'. The significance of January 26 is tied to the Lahore Session of Congress in December 1929, which declared 'Poorna Swaraj', and designated 'January 26, 1930' as the first Independence Day. Therefore, the Reason provides an incorrect historical justification for the chosen date. Since A is true and R is false, the correct option is (c)."

The text confirms the original number was 389 and explains: \"The Muslim League boycotted the Constituent Assembly... Consequently, the members representing the territories which went to Pakistan withdrew... As a result, the membership of the Constituent Assembly of India stood at 299 against the original number of 389 members.\" Therefore, Reason (R) is true.\n3. **Connection Analysis:** The Reason (R) explains the historical event that led to the reduction of the Assembly's total membership to 299. The Assertion (A) states the number of members (284) who were present to sign out of this reduced total of 299. The reduction mentioned in R is the direct cause for why the pool of potential signatories was 299 and not the original 389. Thus, R provides the necessary context and is the correct explanation for the situation described in A. The question requires connecting information from two separate paragraphs about the Assembly's composition and the final signing."

He incorporated two key constitutional mechanisms to achieve this:\n1. Single Citizenship: This ensures that every citizen of India has the same rights and privileges, irrespective of the state they reside in, fostering a common Indian identity and preventing regional allegiances from overriding national ones.\n2. Single Judiciary: He established an integrated judicial system to ensure uniformity in the application of fundamental laws across the country. This prevents legal fragmentation and reinforces the authority of the Union's legal framework.",

This legal sanction enabled the Constituent Assembly to function after India's independence. The Assembly became a sovereign body... At the Lahore Session... in December 1929, a resolution was passed which declared Poorna Swaraj... January 26, 1930 was fixed as the first Independence Day... January 26 was designated as the Republic Day... Dr. Rajendra Prasad... took over as the President of the Indian Union.\"\n\n(i) What was the primary implication of the Constituent Assembly being declared a ‘sovereign body’? [1]\n(ii) The Objectives Resolution declared that India would be a 'republic'. Explain how the choice of January 26th for the Constitution's enforcement and the change in the head of state after this date, collectively fulfilled this declaration. [2]",
          "model_answer_text": "(i) The primary implication of the Constituent Assembly becoming a ‘sovereign body’ was that it was supreme and fully independent, no longer subject to any limitations or authority imposed by the British Parliament. It had the ultimate power to draft the Constitution for India according to the will of its people.\n\n(ii) The declaration of India as a 'republic' was fulfilled in two ways:\n1.  **Symbolic Date:** The enforcement on January 26th linked the Constitution to the 'Poorna Swaraj' (Complete Independence) resolution of 1929. This date, designated as Republic Day, symbolized the final severance of ties with the British monarchy and the establishment of a government of the people.\n2.  **Elected Head of State:** On this date, the post of the Governor-General (representing the Crown) was abolished and Dr. Rajendra Prasad, who was the President of the Constituent Assembly, took over as the first President of the Indian Union. A republic is characterized by an elected head of state, not a hereditary monarch or their representative.",

It regulates the position and powers of the three organs of the government: the legislative, the executive, and the judiciary.\n2.  It moderates the relationship between the government and the governed, protecting citizens' interests by restraining the government from taking arbitrary decisions.\n3.  It lays down the framework to ensure smooth governance for the welfare of its citizens, distinguishing a democratic government from an absolute monarchy.\n\n(c) The date of adoption is the day the Constituent Assembly passed and formally accepted the final draft of the Constitution.

This was on January 26, 1950.\nWhile the Constitution was adopted in 1949, the enforcement was delayed until 1950 to commemorate the historical significance of January 26, which was celebrated as Poorna Swaraj Day since 1930.

As a result, the membership of the Constituent Assembly of India was reduced from the original 389 members to 299 members.\n\n(c) The Constituent Assembly was considered 'truly national in character' because it gave representation to all shades of public opinion and various communities, even beyond the initial scope of the Cabinet Mission plan. The Congress leaders ensured that communities like the Anglo-Indians (represented by Frank Anthony), Indian Christians (represented by H.C. Mukherjee), Parsees (represented by Dr. H.P. Modi), Scheduled Castes, and Scheduled Tribes were included. Even after the League's boycott, members like Zafar Imam and Mohammad Saadullah represented the Muslim community.

At the time of its signing, it consisted of 395 Articles and Eight Schedules.\n\n(b) The Draft Constitution was discussed clause by clause in the Constituent Assembly. This began with the First Reading on November 4, 1948. This was followed by a detailed discussion in the Second Reading, which was completed on October 17, 1949. Finally, the Third and final Reading was completed on November 26, 1949, when the Constitution was passed.\n\n(c) Certain clauses, particularly those relating to citizenship, came into force immediately on November 26, 1949, to address the urgent situation created by the partition of India. The partition had resulted in a massive displacement of people, with millions migrating across the newly formed borders. It was essential to immediately establish a legal framework to define who was an Indian citizen. This allowed persons displaced as a result of the partition to register themselves as Indian citizens without delay, thereby securing their legal status and rights in the new nation. The rest of the Constitution was enforced later on January 26, 1950.",

It was fully independent and had the supreme power to frame any constitution it deemed fit for the country, without any external authority or control.\n\n(c) As a sovereign body, the Constituent Assembly could function freely and structure its work as it saw fit. This enabled it to appoint various committees to deal with different aspects of the constitution-making process. The most important of these was the Drafting Committee, which was set up on August 29, 1947, under the Chairmanship of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar. This committee was entrusted with the crucial task of preparing the actual draft of the Constitution based on the reports of other committees and the principles decided by the Assembly.",

The Constitution of India came into effect on 26th January 1950.\n(b) A Constitution moderates the relationship between the government and the governed by regulating the powers of the three organs of government (legislative, executive, judiciary) and protecting the interests of the citizens. It restrains the government from taking arbitrary decisions, thus ensuring a balance of power and safeguarding citizen rights.\n(c) A democratic government is based on a Constitution which ensures smooth governance for the welfare of its citizens, guarantees rights, and defines the limits of governmental power. In contrast, an absolute monarchy or dictatorship is characterized by the arbitrary rule of a single person or group, without any constitutional checks, balances, or guaranteed rights for the people.",

[3]\n(b) Explain the impact of the Muslim League's boycott and the subsequent partition of India on the membership of the Constituent Assembly. State the original and revised membership numbers.

How did its role change after this point until 1952? [4]",
          "model_answer_text": "(a) The Constituent Assembly was established under the proposals of the Cabinet Mission of 1946. Its initial total strength was 389 members. Members from the Provincial Legislative Assemblies were elected indirectly (by the Lower House only), while representatives from the Princely States were nominated by their respective rulers.\n\n(b) The Muslim League boycotted the Constituent Assembly to demand Pakistan. Consequently, after partition, members representing territories that went to Pakistan withdrew from the Assembly. This reduced the membership of the Constituent Assembly of India from the original 389 to 299.\n\n(c) Dr. Rajendra Prasad was elected President of the Constituent Assembly on December 11, 1946. The Assembly became a sovereign body after India's independence. This was enabled by the legal sanction of the Indian Independence Act, 1947. After this, the Constituent Assembly also functioned as the provisional parliament of India until the first General Elections were held in 1951–52.",

The state would safeguard the rights of minorities and backward classes.\n\n(c) The principles of the 'Objectives Resolution' directly influenced Dr. Ambedkar's work. The goal of granting Fundamental Rights was realized through his incorporation of the Right to Constitutional Remedies to ensure these rights were not infringed. The goal of safeguarding minorities and backward classes was addressed through his provision of special safeguards and a system of reservation for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.",

However, when India achieved actual independence, August 15, 1947, became the official Independence Day. To honour the historical significance of January 26 and the pledge of Poorna Swaraj, the framers of the Constitution chose this date for its full enforcement.

Describe the method of election for its members. [3]\n(b) The Constituent Assembly was described as being 'truly national in character'. Justify this statement by analysing its diverse composition. [3]\n(c) What was the 'Objectives Resolution'? Discuss any four of its key objectives that laid down the 'national goals' for the future Indian Republic. [4]",
          "model_answer_text": "(a) The Cabinet Mission, which arrived in India in 1946, put forward a proposal to set up a Constituent Assembly to frame the Constitution for India. The members of this Assembly were to be elected indirectly by the Provincial Legislative Assemblies (Lower House only). Additionally, the Princely States were to be represented by members nominated by their respective rulers. The elections to the Provincial Assembly were completed by July 1946, leading to the formation of the Constituent Assembly.\n\n(b) The statement that the Constituent Assembly was 'truly national in character' is justified because it gave representation to all shades of public opinion and communities, going beyond the three categories (General, Muslims, Sikhs) specified by the Cabinet Mission plan. Congress leaders ensured that other communities were represented. For example:\n1. The Anglo-Indians were represented by Mr. Frank Anthony and Mr. S.H. Prater.\n2. The Indian Christians were represented by Dr. H.C. Mukherjee and Joseph D'souza.\n3. The Parsees were represented by Dr. H.P. Modi.\n4. Even after the Muslim League's boycott, the Muslim community was represented by members like Zafar Imam and Mohammad Saadullah.\n5. The Sikhs were represented by Sardar Hukum Singh and Ujjal Singh.\nThis broad-based representation ensured that the interests and perspectives of various sections of Indian society were considered.\n\n(c) The 'Objectives Resolution' was a resolution proposed by Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru on December 13, 1946, which highlighted the objectives of the Constitution and laid down the 'national goals' for independent India. The four key objectives were:\n1. **Republic:** It declared that free India would be a republic, meaning the head of the state would be an elected person and not a hereditary monarch.\n2. **Socio-economic and political justice:** It aimed to guarantee the ideals of social, political, and economic democracy for all citizens.\n3. **Fundamental Rights:** The resolution proposed that the republic would grant and guarantee Fundamental Rights to all its citizens, ensuring individual liberty and freedom.\n4. **Safeguards for Minorities:** It resolved that the state would provide adequate safeguards for the rights and interests of minorities, backward classes, and tribal areas.",

In this context, answer the following:\n(a) Who was the Chairman of the Drafting Committee? Analyse any two of his significant contributions that shaped the principles of the Constitution. [3]\n(b) Explain the process of 'Readings' that the Draft Constitution went through in the Constituent Assembly. What was the total time taken to complete this process? [3]\n(c) Differentiate between the 'adoption' and the 'enforcement' of the Constitution, stating the respective dates. Explain the historical significance of January 26 being chosen as the date of enforcement. [4]",
          "model_answer_text": "(a) The Chairman of the Drafting Committee was Dr. B.R. Ambedkar. His two significant contributions that shaped the principles of the Constitution are:\n1. **Incorporation of Safeguards for Minorities and Weaker Sections:** Dr. Ambedkar ensured the text of the Constitution provided for constitutional guarantees and protections for minorities and certain classes who are socially and educationally backward. This included a system of reservation of jobs in government services for members of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and the abolition of untouchability.\n2. **Ensuring Fundamental Rights and Constitutional Remedies:** He incorporated the 'Right to Constitutional Remedies' to ensure that the Fundamental Rights of individuals are not infringed upon by the Centre or State governments. This provision makes the Fundamental Rights justiciable and is crucial for protecting civil liberties.\n\n(b) After the draft was prepared, it was thoroughly discussed in the Constituent Assembly through a process involving three readings:\n1. **First Reading:** The Draft was introduced in the Assembly in November 1948 and was discussed clause by clause.\n2. **Second Reading:** This was a more detailed examination, which was completed on October 17, 1949.\n3. **Third and Final Reading:** This reading was completed on November 26, 1949, after which the Constitution was passed and adopted.\nThe entire process for the Constituent Assembly to finally pass the Constitution took nearly three years (specifically, 2 years, 11 months and 18 days, though the text states 'nearly three years').\n\n(c) The difference between 'adoption' and 'enforcement' is as follows:\n*   **Adoption:** The Constitution was 'adopted and passed' by the Constituent Assembly on **November 26, 1949**. This signifies the legal finalisation and acceptance of the document by the framers.\n*   **Enforcement:** The Constitution as a whole 'came into force' on **January 26, 1950**. This is the date from which its provisions became legally binding for the governance of the country.\n\nThe historical significance of choosing January 26 is that at the Lahore Session of the Congress in December 1929, a resolution was passed declaring **Poorna Swaraj** (Complete Independence) as the objective. Subsequently, **January 26, 1930**, was celebrated as the first 'Independence Day'. To honour this historic day, January 26 was chosen as the 'Republic Day' when the Constitution came into force, even though India became independent on August 15, 1947.",

          "question_text": "The Indian Independence Act of 1947 conferred upon the Constituent Assembly a unique dual character, transforming its legal status and scope of work. Analyze this statement by explaining the two distinct sovereign functions the Assembly performed post-August 1947. Furthermore, deduce how the principle of a 'strong Centre', advocated by Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, was a logical constitutional outcome given the Assembly's experience in its legislative capacity during the tumultuous post-partition period.",
          "model_answer_text": "The statement is accurate. Post-August 15, 1947, the Indian Independence Act transformed the Constituent Assembly into a sovereign body, empowering it to perform a dual role:\n\n1.  **Constituent Function:** Its primary and original mandate was to frame the Constitution for a free India. As a sovereign body, free from the constraints of the Cabinet Mission plan, it could draft a constitution reflecting the nation's own ideals. This is evidenced by the setting up of the Drafting Committee on August 29, 1947, to create the foundational legal text.\n\n2.  **Legislative Function:** It also functioned as the first, provisional Parliament of India. The text states, \"The Constituent Assembly became the provisional parliament until the new General Elections were held in 1951–52.\" In this capacity, it governed the country, made ordinary laws, and managed the administration during the critical transition period.\n\n**Deductive Link to 'Strong Centre':**\nDr. Ambedkar's advocacy for a 'strong Centre' can be deduced as a response to the challenges faced by the Assembly in its legislative capacity. The immediate aftermath of independence and partition brought immense administrative and integration challenges, including managing displaced populations and unifying the nation. Governing the country as a provisional parliament would have highlighted the dangers of fragmentation and the need for administrative discipline and territorial integrity. Therefore, incorporating principles like a strong Centre, single citizenship, and a single judiciary into the constitution was a logical step to ensure the stability and unity of the new republic, a lesson learned firsthand from the practical experience of governance.",

          "model_answer_text": "Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, in his role as the Chairman of the Drafting Committee, systematically translated the abstract ideals of the Objectives Resolution and the inclusive vision of the Constituent Assembly into concrete, workable constitutional mechanisms. This is evident through the following examples:\n\n1.  **Safeguarding Minorities and Backward Classes:** The Objectives Resolution explicitly mandated that the state would \"safeguard the rights of minorities and backward classes.\" The Constituent Assembly's 'national character' was demonstrated by the presence of representatives from various communities like Anglo-Indians (Mr. Frank Anthony), Parsees (Dr. H.P. Modi), and Scheduled Castes. Dr. Ambedkar directly addressed this national goal by incorporating \"special safeguards\" for minorities and a system of \"reservation of jobs in the government services for members of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes,\" thereby giving constitutional force to the aspirations of these represented groups.\n\n2.  **Guaranteeing Enforceable Fundamental Rights:** The Objectives Resolution declared that the republic would grant \"Fundamental Rights\" to all citizens. Dr. Ambedkar ensured this was not a mere declaration. He architected the crucial \"Right to Constitutional Remedies,\" a provision he considered the 'heart and soul' of the Constitution. This right empowers citizens to approach the judiciary if their rights are infringed, making the guarantee of rights enforceable and not just a promise, thus fulfilling a core objective in a robust manner.\n\n3.  **Ensuring Socio-Economic Democracy:** The Objectives Resolution aimed to secure \"social, political and economic democracy\" for all people. To achieve the social and economic dimensions of this goal, Dr. Ambedkar incorporated the \"Directive Principles of State Policy.\" These principles, while not judicially enforceable, are fundamental guidelines for governance, aiming to establish a welfare state and ensure social and economic justice. This provision directly translates the abstract ideal of economic democracy into a constitutional objective for the state to pursue for the welfare of all citizens.",
