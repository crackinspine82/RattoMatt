The **Tripuri Session of the Congress** in **1939** saw the widening of the gulf between the two wings of the Congress Party. The left wing led by Bose wanted the Congress to help the people of the **Princely States** in their struggle for freedom, whereas Gandhiji criticised their demand.\n4. As Britain started facing difficulties in Europe because of the German threat, Gandhiji wanted to adopt a compromising attitude towards the British and he was opposed to any national struggle during the War. Bose wanted to take advantage of the difficulties faced by the British."

Bose won by a majority of votes. Gandhiji declared that the defeat of Bose's rival was his (Gandhiji's) own defeat.

Majority of the delegates who had supported Bose reconfirmed their confidence in the leadership of Gandhiji. This created a deadlock between Bose and Gandhiji. The Gandhi wing began to oppose the President to make it impossible for him to function. Bose resigned from the presidentship of the Congress on **April 29, 1939**."
