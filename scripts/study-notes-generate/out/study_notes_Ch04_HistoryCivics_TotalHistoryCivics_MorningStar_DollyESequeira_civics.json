      "content_md": "**Election** is a procedure whereby persons are chosen, by voting, to represent the voters for running the government. Generally, there is a contest between different candidates for the same position.\n\nIn modern societies, elections are fought on party lines. A **political party** is a group of people holding similar views or beliefs. Any political party or a combination of parties getting the largest number of votes forms the government."

Other types include General Elections, Mid-Term Elections, and By-Elections.\n\n**General Elections**: The elections held to elect the members of the Lok Sabha after the expiry of the normal term of five years are called the **General Elections**.

      "title": "Indirect Elections",
      "level_label": "Subtopic",
      "content_md": "In **Indirect Elections**, representatives are not directly elected by the people. Instead, the elected representatives of the people elect these members.\n\n- **Legislatures in India**: India has two types of legislatures at the Union and State level. At the state level, some states have a second house called **Vidhan Parishad** (Legislative Council). At the Union level, the upper house is the **Rajya Sabha**, which is a permanent house.\n- **Election to Upper Houses**: The elected representatives of the people elect the members of the Upper House at both the Centre and the State.\n\n**Rajya Sabha Composition**: \n- Consists of not more than **250 members**.\n- **238 members** are elected by the elected members of the Legislative Assembly of each State.\n- **12 members** are nominated by the President from persons having special knowledge in literature, science, art, and social service.\n\n**Election of the President and the Vice-President of India**:\n- **President of India**: Elected indirectly by the members of an **Electoral College**. This college consists of:\n  - The elected members of both Houses of Parliament.\n  - The elected members of the Legislative Assemblies of the States (including the National Capital Territory of Delhi and the Union Territory of Puducherry).\n- The election follows the system of **proportional representation** by means of a **single transferable vote**.\n- **Vice-President of India**: Election is also indirect. The Vice-President is elected by members of both Houses of Parliament. State Legislatures do not participate in this election.\n\n**Differences Between Direct and Indirect Elections**\n\n**Direct Elections**\n1. People vote directly to elect their representatives.\n2. Law regulates the qualifications, age, etc., of voters and establishes eligibility requirements for state officials.\n3. Every adult person holds the right to vote.\n4. There is a very large body of voters called the **electorate**.\n5. Members of Legislative Assemblies and members of Lok Sabha are elected directly.\n\n**Indirect Elections**\n1. People elect their representatives indirectly through their elected representatives. For example, members of Rajya Sabha are elected by the elected members of State Legislative Assemblies.\n2. All elected representatives are treated at par. There are no further qualifications. Eligibility requirement for State officials is similar to that in direct elections.\n3. Every elected representative holds the right to vote.\n4. There is a very small body of voters.\n5. The Members of state Legislative councils, Members of Rajya Sabha, the President of India and the Vice President are elected indirectly."
