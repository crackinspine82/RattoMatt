It was a part of a large project of history writing commissioned by Akbar. It is regarded as a precious source of information about the administration and culture during the reign of Akbar.\nThe **Ain-i-Akbari** is divided into five books. The **first book** deals with the **imperial household**. The **second book** deals with the servants of the emperor, the **military and civil services**. The **third book** deals with the **imperial administration**. It consists of the regulations for the **judicial and executive departments**, and the divisions of the empire. The **fourth book** contains information about Hindu philosophy, science, social customs and literature. The **fifth book** contains the **wise sayings of Akbar**. This also contains an account of the ancestry and biography of the author, **Abul Fazl**.\n\n2.  **The Taj Mahal, Agra**: It was built by **Shah Jahan** in memory of his beloved wife **Mumtaz Mahal**. It is the **mausoleum** of both Mumtaz Mahal and Shah Jahan. It is built at **Agra** on the banks of the **River Yamuna**. It was designed by **Ustad Isha Khan** and it is made of pure white marble. The main structure is constructed on a high platform. On each of the four corners of this platform there is a minaret. The central dome rises to a height of 56.1 metres. The interior has an octagonal chamber. The marble dome in the centre looks like an inverted lotus. The actual graves are in lower chamber, underground.\nThe entire structure of Taj Mahal is made of marble and the walls are decorated with floral designs made of semi-precious stones. This method of decoration is called **pietra dura**. The **Taj Mahal** brought together all the architectural forms developed by the Mughals like massive domes of marble, **pietra dura** inlay work and **kiosks (chhatris)**.\nTaj Mahal was designated as a **UNESCO World Heritage site in 1983** and was declared as one of the **Seven Wonders of the World in 2007**.\n[Image: Taj Mahal]\n\n3.  **The Jama Masjid**: It was built by **Shah Jahan** and is the biggest mosque in India. Its courtyard has the capacity to accommodate thousands of people at a time. It is built on a lofty basement with majestic flights of steps leading to the imposing gateways on three sides of the courtyard. It has three gateways, four towers and two 40m high minarets constructed of red sandstone and white marble. The northern gate has 39 steps, the eastern gate has 35 steps and the southern gate has 33 steps. The face of its spacious prayer-hall consists of eleven arches of which the central arch rises far above the roof level.\n[Image: Jama Masjid]\n\n4.  **The Red Fort, Delhi**: It was built by **Shah Jahan** after he decided to shift his capital to **Delhi**. It is located on the banks of the **Yamuna**. Red sandstone and marble were used in its construction. The fort has massive walls and two gateways. The Western Gateway is known as the **Lahori Gate**. This gate was used for the emperor's ceremonial purposes. Among the many impressive buildings in the complex are **Diwan-i-Aam** and **Diwan-i-Khas**. The **Diwan-i-Khas** is the lavishly ornamented hall where the **Peacock Throne** was placed. The hall was used by the emperor to give audience to the princes of the royal family, nobles and other important dignitaries. **Aurangzeb** later built the **Moti Masjid** in the Red Fort. It is made of pure marble. The Red Fort is an important historical monument. Many historical events are connected with this fort. The **Prime Minister of India** every year hoists the national flag from its ramparts on **Independence Day (August 15)**.\n[Image: Red Fort, Delhi]"

While most of these were Rajput rajas, many of whom entered into matrimonial alliances with Akbar, **mansabs** (position or rank) were given to others on the basis of their competence.\n3. In **1575**, Akbar built a hall called **Ibadat Khana** or the **Hall of Prayer** at Fatehpur Sikri. At this hall, he used to call selected theologians of all religions, mystics and intellectuals and discuss religious and spiritual matters with them.\n4. Akbar issued a '**Declaration**' or **mahzar**, which made Akbar the supreme or final arbiter in religious matters and replaced the power of the **ulema** by the power of the **Emperor**.\n5. Akbar promulgated a new faith called **Din-i-Illahi**. It was based on the principle of **oneness of God**. The new religion stressed on virtues like courage, loyalty and justice. It also demanded loyalty to the Emperor. The basic purpose of forming Din-i-Illahi was **Sulh-kul** or **universal harmony** which governed all public policies of Akbar.\n6. Akbar set up a large translation department for translating works in Sanskrit, Arabic and Greek into Persian. Thus, the **Singhasan Battisi**, the **Atharva Veda** and the **Bible** were taken up for translation. These were followed by the **Quran**, the **Mahabharata**, the **Gita** and the **Ramayana**."

The higher the zat, the more prestigious was the noble's position in court and the larger his salary.

Thus, a noble was expected to maintain a quota of only one-third of his sawar rank and in some cases, one-fourth.
