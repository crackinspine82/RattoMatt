It is about 125km from **Jhansi in Uttar Pradesh**. It is one of the earliest Hindu stone temples to survive till date. It was the first North Indian temple with a **Shikhara** or tower, although a part of it has disappeared. Inspite of its dilapidated condition, the temple has a compelling presence.\n\nThe temple was built on a 1.5 metre high platform. Four stairways outside the platform provide access to the temple. Its exterior is decorated with scenes from **Ramayana**. The entrance and pillars are adorned with countless paintings and carvings. The front entrance has sculptures of various Gods and Godesses in moods varying from contemplation to affection and above them is Vishnu flanked by two of his avataras **Narasimha** and **Vamana**. On each of the three sides of the temple, a niche is made in the wall. Carved into them are dramatic representations of Lord Vishnu's various forms. One nook has Vishnu asleep on the coil of the giant serpent called **Sheshnaga**.\n\nThe niche at the back shows the concept of **Nar Narayana** or the fusion of divine and the human. The third niche depicts Lord Vishnu coming to the aid of the trapped elephant, Gaja in the famous story of **Gajendra moksha**.\n\nUnfortunately, the idol of the deity inside the temple is missing.\n\nThe Dashavatara temple is locally known as the **Sagar marh**, which literally means, 'the temple on the tank', a name it gets from the square water pool cut into the rock in front."
