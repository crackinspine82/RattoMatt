      "content_md": "The **Sangam Age** is a landmark in the history of South India. The word 'Sangam' is the Tamil form of the Sanskrit 'Sangha', meaning an assembly or association. The Sangam Age refers to the period when Tamil literature was composed by scholars and poets in three successive literary gatherings called **Sangam**, which took place between the first century BC and the second century AD in the kingdom of Pandyas. These texts were composed and compiled in assemblies of poets held in Madurai.\n\n*   **First Sangam:** Believed to have been attended by Gods and legendary sages including Sage Agastya, but all its works have perished.\n*   **Second Sangam:** Attended by several poets. Only **Tolkappiyam** by **Tolkappiar** (the oldest book of Tamil grammar) has survived.\n*   **Third Sangam:** Attended by many poets and produced a vast literature, of which a fraction survived. This fraction constitutes the extant body of **Sangam literature**.\n\nThe themes of Sangam literature are the wars and heroic deeds of the three kingdoms of **Cheras**, **Pandyas**, and **Cholas**."

      "content_md": "**Tirukkural** is one of the most celebrated works of the eighteen minor works (**Patinenkilkanakku**) of the Sangam literature. It was written by **Tiruvalluvar**, a Tamil poet and philosopher.\n\n*   It is considered a compound of the teachings of the **Dharamashastra**, the **Arthashastra**, and the **Kamasutra**.\n*   It comprises a series of brief metrical proverbs on many aspects of life and religion, organized as a collection of Tamil couplets in **133 chapters**.\n*   Each chapter covers a specific subject, from \"ploughing a piece of land\" to \"ruling a country\", and preaches simplicity and truth.\n*   The 133 chapters are grouped into three sections:\n    *   (a) **Aram** (righteousness): Discusses ethical living in private life.\n    *   (b) **Porul** (wealth): Deals with public affairs.\n    *   (c) **Inbam** or **Kamam** (pleasure): Discusses ethical living in private life.\n\n[Image: Thiruvalluvar]\n\nAdditionally, Tamil literature comprises five epics: **Jivakachintamani**, **Manimekalai**, **Silappadikaram**, **Valayapathi**, and **Kuntalakeshi**. These epics are a source of information about music, dance, administration, and the grandeur of Kings."

      "content_md": "**Megaliths** are box-like structures erected with stone slabs, resting on each other without any mortar. They acted as either **burial sites** or **commemorative memorials**.\n\n*   Some megaliths are on the surface, while others are underground. Stone circles or boulders on the surface likely served as signposts to the burial site.\n*   Some megaliths contain more than one skeleton, indicating that people from the same family were buried in the same place at different times. They are also known as **memorial stones**.\n*   They contained not only skeletons but also **grave goods** like pottery and iron objects, which provide insight into the life of people during the Sangam Age.\n*   **Inferences from Megaliths:**\n    *   The smaller number of agricultural tools compared to hunting and fishing tools suggests that the megalithic people did not initially practice advanced agriculture.\n    *   Religious beliefs can be inferred. For example, the presence of **tridents** in graves indicates faith in Lord Shiva.\n\nRenowned historian **Champakalakshmi** identified the Sangam Age with the last phase of the megalithic culture in the Tamil region. She correlated the **velir settlements** from literature with megalithic sites. This period's subsistence base consisted of agriculture, cattle rearing, fishing, the use of iron, and frequent warfare.\n\n[Image: Megalith Burial]\n\n[Image: Megaliths]\n\n**Note on Modern Threats to Megalithic Sites:** Ancient structures face threats from modern construction and unauthorised excavations. For example:\n*   The 'pillared dolmen' (locally 'Pandava Gullu') near Tirupati, estimated to be 2,500 years old, was nearly damaged by granite mining.\n*   An endangered megalith monument in Palem village (locally 'Devara Yeddhu') has been damaged by treasure hunters.\n*   A 'stone circle' megalithic burial site in Venkatapuram has been damaged by the installation of a mobile tower."
