# The Harappan Civilisation

## BRONZE AGE CIVILISATIONS
- The first metal discovered was copper. The period when both stone and copper tools were used is known as the **Chalcolithic Period**.
- Later, humans learned to mix copper with tin or zinc to produce the alloy **Bronze**. Bronze is harder and more ductile than copper, making it more suitable for tools and weapons.
- Civilisations that grew due to the importance of bronze are known as **Bronze Age Civilisations**.
- By about 2500 BC, four major bronze age civilisations had emerged:
    1.  The **Harappan Civilisation** in northern and western India and Pakistan.
    2.  The **Mesopotamian Civilisation** on the banks of the Euphrates and Tigris rivers in modern Iraq.
    3.  The **Chinese Civilisation** in the valley of the Hwang Ho and Yangtze rivers.
    4.  The **Egyptian Civilisation** on the banks of the Nile river in Egypt.

## THE HARAPPAN CIVILISATION
- The **Harappan Civilisation** is the first civilisation that arose in the north-western regions of the Indian subcontinent.
- It is named after **Harappa**, the first major site of this civilisation discovered in 1921 in West Punjab, Pakistan.
- It is also known as the **Indus Valley Civilisation** because many of its important early sites are located in the valley of the river Indus.
- The discovery of this civilisation in the 20th century pushed back the history of India by at least a thousand years, placing it on par with the Mesopotamian and Egyptian Civilisations.
- It is also referred to as the **Harappan Culture**. The term **'Culture'** is used by archaeologists for a group of objects distinctive in style, that are usually found together within a specific geographical area and period of time. For Harappan culture, these distinctive objects are seals, weights, stone blades, and baked bricks.

## SOURCES
Knowledge of the Harappan Civilisation is based entirely on archaeological remains as the script has not yet been deciphered.

### The Great Bath
- One of the largest public buildings at **Mohenjo-daro**.
- It is a large rectangular tank in a courtyard surrounded by a corridor. Two flights of steps lead into the tank.
- **Construction**: Made watertight using burnt bricks and mortar lined with bitumen and gypsum. Water was supplied by a well in an adjacent room.
- **Features**: Surrounded by porticos, sets of rooms, and a stairway to an upper storey. The rooms may have been used by priests or for changing clothes.
- **Purpose**: Believed to be for some form of ritual bathing.
- **Significance as a Source**:
    - Indicates the art of building had reached a high degree of perfection.
    - The massive structure suggests the existence of a ruling class that could mobilise labour and collect taxes.
    - The design shows efficient planning for water supply and sewage disposal.
    - It highlights the importance of ceremonial bathing in their culture.
    - The use of standardised bricks (sun-dried or baked) points to significant planning.

### The Citadel
- The **Citadel** was the raised area of each city, built on mud brick platforms.
- It contained the houses of the ruling class and important buildings such as the Great Bath, the granary, the assembly hall, and workshops.
- **Significance as a Source**:
    - It points to the elaborate planning of an urban civilisation.
    - The presence of specific buildings for a ruling class indicates some form of political organisation and social classification.
    - It housed buildings meant for public purposes.

### Seals
- About 2000 seals have been discovered, showcasing the Harappans' artistic skills.
- **Features**: Most are rectangular or square, made of terracotta, steatite, or agate. They comprise short inscriptions with pictures of animals like the one-horned bull, buffalo, tiger, goat, elephant, and rhinoceros.
- **Significance as a Source**:
    - **Religion**: The **Pashupati seal** depicts a three-faced deity, identified as **Pashupati Mahadeva** (an early form of Shiva), indicating a belief in Shiva. The unicorn seal suggests mythical beliefs.
    - **Trade**: Seals were used by traders to stamp their goods. A seal's impression on a clay layer over a knotted bag served as a mark of authenticity and ownership. The discovery of these seals across a vast area indicates widespread trade.
    - **Other Uses**: Seals were also likely used as amulets or as a form of identity card.

### Dockyard
- A rectangular dockyard was discovered at **Lothal** in Gujarat, believed to be one of the oldest in the world.
- **Features**: It was surrounded by a massive brick wall for protection against floods and was connected by channels to the Gulf of Cambay. Remains of stone anchors, marine shells, and seals traceable to the Persian Gulf have been found. A warehouse structure was also identified nearby.
- **Function**: It was scientifically designed to handle tides and had a water-locking system, indicating Lothal was an important port and trading centre.
- **Significance**:
    - It indicates the existence of both internal and external trade.
    - It testifies to the advanced hydraulic knowledge of the Harappans.

### Script
- The Harappan script is **pictographic**, with signs representing birds, fish, and varieties of the human form.
- **Features**:
    - About 375-400 signs are known.
    - The script is found on seals, copper tools, jar rims, terracotta tablets, jewellery, and an ancient signboard.
    - It was not alphabetical, as it has too many signs.
    - It was written from **right to left**, as evident from the spacing on seals.
    - The presence of the script on a wide variety of objects suggests that many people were literate.
- The script has **not been deciphered**.

## ORIGIN OF THE CIVILISATION
There are two main theories regarding the origin of the Harappan Civilisation.

### Foreign Origin
- This theory suggests that the civilisation was an offshoot of the **Mesopotamian Civilisation**, resulting from a sudden migration of people to the Indus basin.
- This view has been rejected due to striking differences between the two civilisations and the lack of evidence of trade with Mesopotamia during the early Harappan period.

### Indigenous Origin
- Recent research suggests the roots of the Harappan Civilisation lie in the Indian soil.
- The urban Harappan culture is seen as an outgrowth of extensive local village cultures.
- Historians found similarities between pre-Harappan cultures (at Kot Diji, Amri, Kalibangan) and the mature Harappan culture in terms of granaries, defensive walls, and long-distance trade.
- This suggests the Harappan Civilisation evolved from these local agricultural communities.

## URBAN PLANNING

### HARAPPAN CITIES
- **Extent**: The civilisation covered a triangular area of about 1.3 million sq. km. It extended from Sutkagendor (west) to Alamgirpur (east), and from Manda (north) to Bhagatrav (south).
- **Major Sites**:
    - **Pakistan**: Harappa, Mohenjo-daro, Chanhudaro, Sutkagendor.
    - **India**: Manda, Banawali, Kalibangan, Alamgirpur, Lothal, Rupar, Rangpur, and **Dholavira**.
- **Dholavira**: Located in Gujarat, it is a UNESCO World Heritage site and one of the best-preserved urban settlements.
- **Largest Sites**: Mohenjo-daro, Harappa, Kalibangan, and Lothal.
- The ruins of **Mohenjo-daro** were designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1980.

### COMMON ELEMENTS BETWEEN MOHENJO-DARO AND HARAPPA
- Both are located on river banks (Mohenjo-daro on the Indus, Harappa on the Ravi).
- Both measured around 5.0 km in circuit.
- They shared common ground plans, including the layout of streets and house blocks.
- Water supply, drainage systems, and granaries were common to both cities.
- Both featured indoor plumbing, paved bathrooms, and a network of brick-lined sewage channels.

### FEATURES OF URBAN PLANNING
- The most striking feature of the civilisation is its urban planning, which was based on a **grid pattern**.
- **Main Characteristics**:
    1.  **City Division**: Each city was divided into two parts: the raised **'Citadel'** and the **'lower town'**. The Citadel housed important public buildings, while the lower town had residential areas.
    2.  **Streets**: The main streets followed a grid pattern, running from north to south or east to west.
    3.  **Street Corners**: Houses at street corners were rounded to allow carts to pass easily.
    4.  **Drainage System**: House drains emptied all wastewater into the street drains.
    5.  **City Blocks**: Streets crossed the main road at right angles, dividing the city into square or rectangular blocks.

## HOUSES
- **Set Plan**: Residential buildings were built on a high mound to protect them from floods.
- **Variations**: Houses varied from single-room tenements to larger houses with courtyards, up to twelve rooms, private wells, and toilets.
- **Drainage**: Each house had covered drains connected to the main street drains.
- **Entrances**: House entrances were from narrow lanes, not the main roads.
- **Layout**: The kitchen was in a sheltered corner of the courtyard. The ground floor had storerooms and well chambers.
- **Materials**: Houses were made of brick and wood, with doors, windows, and ventilators.

## MONUMENTAL ARCHITECTURE

### The Great Bath
- For details, refer to the **Sources** section in this chapter.

### Granaries
- Granaries have been found at Mohenjo-daro, Harappa, Lothal, and Kalibangan.
- **At Harappa**: Two rows of six granaries each were found. South of the granaries were circular brick platforms for threshing grain. Two-roomed barracks, possibly for labourers, were also found.
- **Features**: They were built on raised platforms to protect them from floods and had ventilation to prevent grains from becoming mildewed. Their location near the river Ravi suggests that food grains were brought by boat.

## TRADE
The Harappans had a highly developed system of trade, indicated by granaries, seals, a uniform script, and regulated weights and measures.

### Internal Trade
- The Harappans traded in stone, metal, shell, etc., within the Indus civilisation zone.
- They used a **barter system** as no metal money was used.
- **Important Centres**:
    - **Metallurgy**: Mohenjo-daro, Harappa, Lothal.
    - **Bangle-making**: Balakot and Chanhudaro.
    - **Bead-making**: Lothal and Chanhudaro.
- **Trade Routes**: Rice was likely imported to Punjab from Gujarat. Cotton was supplied from Lothal and Surkotada to other towns.

### External Trade
- The Harappans had commercial contacts with Mesopotamia and other West Asian sites.
- **Coastal towns** like Lothal, Surkotada, and Balakot were important for trade.
- Mesopotamian records from c. 2350 BC refer to trade with **Meluha** (the ancient name for the Indus region).
- **Intermediate trading stations** mentioned in Mesopotamian texts are **Dilmun** (Bahrain) and **Makan**.
- **Transport**: Trade was carried out by sea, as depicted by ships and boats on seals. A terracotta model of a ship was found at Lothal. For inland travel, bullock carts were used.
- **Imports**:
    - **Gold**: From North Karnataka and Afghanistan.
    - **Copper**: From Rajasthan, South India, Baluchistan, and Arabia.
    - **Lead**: From East or South India.
- **Weights and Measures**:
    - Harappans used sets of cubical stone weights.
    - The basic unit was 16 (equal to 14 grams). Larger weights were multiples of 16 (32, 64, 128) and smaller ones were fractions of 16.

## ART AND CRAFT
- **Craftsmanship**: All works of Harappan art, including figurines, sculpture, seals, and beads, are products of skilled craftsmen.
- **Weaving**: A piece of woven cotton from Mohenjo-daro shows weaving was an important craft.
- **Other Crafts**: Boat-making, seal-making, and making terracotta articles were also important. Subjects included humans, animals, and birds.
- **Jewellery**: Goldsmiths made jewellery of silver, gold, and precious stones. Bead-making was also a known art.
- **Pottery**: Harappans produced glossy and shining pottery, crafted on a potter's wheel and decorated with black geometrical designs.
- **Sculpture**: Sculptors were skilled in creating highly realistic human and animal figures in stone, bronze, or terracotta. The bust of the bearded man is a well-known example.
- **Terracotta Figurines**: The most important terracotta image is that of the **Mother Goddess**. Male figurines with coiled hair are also found, possibly representing a deity.
- **Bronze-Casting**: This was prevalent on a wide scale, using the **'lost wax' process**. The bronze statue of the dancing girl is a masterpiece of this technique.

## Dress
- **Men**: Wore a garment similar to a **dhoti**, and a shawl as an upper garment.
- **Women**: Wore a skirt and used a cloak to cover their arms and shoulders.
- **Stitching**: The discovery of needles and buttons suggests that some clothes were stitched.

## Ornaments
- Worn by both men and women.
- **Common Ornaments**: Necklaces, finger-rings, bangles, armlets, anklets, nose rings, fan-shaped head-dresses, and earrings.
- **Materials**: Made of gold, silver, precious stones, and ivory.

## Toys and Amusements
- **Games and Activities**: People played dice, and went on hunting and fishing expeditions.
- **Musical Instruments**: The main instruments were the drum and the lyre.
- **Toys**: Included figures of birds, animals, carts, and whistles.

## DECLINE OF THE CIVILISATION
The Harappan Civilisation declined sometime around **1800 BC**. Likely causes include:

### Floods and Earthquakes
- It is believed that repeated floods at Mohenjo-daro, evidenced by layers of silty clay, led to its abandonment.
- Hydrologist R.L. Raikes suggested that earthquakes may have raised the level of the flood plains of the Indus, blocking the river's flow to the sea and causing widespread inundation.

### Increased Aridity
- Historians D.P. Agarwal and Sood proposed that the civilisation declined due to increasing aridity and the drying up of the Ghaggar river.
- Tectonic disturbances caused the Sutlej to join the Indus system and the Yamuna to shift east, leaving the Ghaggar river waterless and leading to ecological imbalance.

### Deforestation
- As a Bronze Age culture, large quantities of wood were needed to produce bronze, bake bricks and pottery, and make boats and furniture.
- This extensive use of wood could have led to large-scale deforestation, causing climatic change in the region.

### Attack
- Historian Mortimer Wheeler believed that the Aryans destroyed the Indus settlements.
- Evidence includes skeletons found in Mohenjo-daro, suggesting a massacre of men, women, and children in the last phase of the city.

## HERITAGE
- The decline of its physical aspects did not lead to the total disappearance of all its traits.
- **Legacy in Crafts**: The Harappan methods of making baked pottery, bricks, beads, jewellery, and textiles were adopted by later civilisations.
- **Legacy in Agriculture**: The cultivation of **cotton** was a remarkable achievement, later adopted by the Egyptians.
- **Legacy in Religion**: Many religious practices have continued, including the worship of **Pashupati (Shiva)**, the **Mother Goddess**, sacred trees, animals, and religious symbols.
