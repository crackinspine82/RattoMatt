The Prime Minister may or may not consult the other Ministers, below the rank of Cabinet Ministers. | 2. They are the most trusted colleagues of the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister always consults them. The decisions of the Cabinet are binding on all the ministers. |\n| 3. In the day-to-day working of the government, the Council of Ministers as a whole rarely meets. | 3. The Cabinet is a small cohesive group of senior Ministers who determine the policy and programme of the Government; so they meet as frequently as possible. |\n| 4. According to the Constitution, the President acts on the advice of the Council of Ministers. In reality, it is not the Council of Ministers but the Cabinet which advises the President. | 4. In day-to-day governance of the country, the Cabinet advises the President, through the Prime Minister. |"
