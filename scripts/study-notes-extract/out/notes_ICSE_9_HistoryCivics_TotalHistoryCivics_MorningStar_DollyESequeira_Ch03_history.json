These **Angas** are collectively known as **Dwadashangi**.\n\n*   The foremost of these **Angas** is **Aacharang Sutra**. It deals with the code of conduct which a Jain monk is required to follow.\n*   Another well-known **Anga** is the **Vyakyha Pragnapti**, more popularly known as **Bhagavati Sutra**. It expounds the Jain doctrines in a comprehensive manner.\n*   Based on these **Angas**, the seers also compiled 12 auxiliary works that came to be known as **Upangas**.\n\nIt is said that these **Angas** and **Upangas** were not written for a long time and were orally passed on by the religious leaders to their pupils.\n\nAccording to historian, R.C. Majumdar, \"Towards the close of the fourth century BC, a famine in South Bihar led to the exodus of an important section of Jainas, headed by **Bhadrabahu**, to South India. Those that remained behind in Pataliputra called for a council, in order to revive the knowledge of the Angas. The result was the compilation of the twelve Angas. At another council held at Valabhi in Gujarat in the fifth or sixth century AD, a final collection of the scriptures was made for the first time in **Ardhmagadhi Prakrit** language\".\n\nThe **Angas** are regarded as the most important part of the Jain doctrines. They discuss religious rites, stages of a householder's life, the vows of chastity, rules of conduct and other features of Jain philosophy."

Mahavira received his early education in all specialised branches. He is said to have been very brave and to have saved his colleagues from dangers.

He got absorbed in spiritual pursuits from early childhood. He was married to **Yashoda**. This was done in order to divert his attention from asceticism.

Like Mahavira, he was inclined from his childhood, towards spiritual pursuits.\n\nAll the royal luxuries in which Gautama lived had no effect on him. He was married at a young age to a princess called **Yashodhara** and had a son named **Rahul**.\n\n**The Great Renunciation**: Once Gautama's charioteer was driving him through the town. The appearance of an old man bent with age moved Gautama. Again the sight of a sick man, groaning with pain, was pathetic. The dead body of a man being carried for cremation made Gautama think about man's destiny. He was consoled when he saw an ascetic in search of salvation. These sights are known as the '**Four Great Sights**'. Gautama left home, his wife and the child in order to find a solution. This event is known as **Mahabhiskramana** or '**The Great Renunciation**'."
