      "content_md": "In the sixth century BC, the Aryan settlements expanded to the east, bringing rapid socio-economic and political changes. In the Later Vedic Age, the use of iron implements led to forest clearance, increased cultivation, and surplus food production. This surplus supported kings' military and administrative needs and allowed people in towns to specialize in arts and crafts, leading to a settled life and further expansion.\n\nThis expansion caused wars between tribes, where larger tribes defeated smaller ones, creating large kingdoms called **janapadas**. A number of janapadas merged to form bigger, more powerful independent kingdoms called **mahajanapadas**.\n\nThe sixth century BC was a significant epoch in world history, witnessing the emergence of thinkers like **Zarathustra** in Persia, **Confucius** in China, and **Mahavira** and **Gautama Buddha** in India. During this period in India, orthodox religious beliefs were challenged by new sects, with **Jainism** and **Buddhism** emerging as the most potent religious reform movements."

      "content_md": "The three important sources that provide information about Jainism and Buddhism are:\n\n**(i) Angas:**\n- It is believed that the teachings of **Lord Mahavira**, after he gained omniscience, were compiled by his disciples into 12 parts called **Angas** (Sanskrit for parts).\n- These Angas are collectively known as **Dwadashangi**.\n- The foremost Anga is the **Aacharang Sutra**, which deals with the code of conduct for a Jain monk.\n- Another well-known Anga is the **Vyakyha Pragnapti**, popularly known as **Bhagavati Sutra**, which explains Jain doctrines comprehensively.\n- Based on the Angas, seers compiled 12 auxiliary works known as **Upangas**.\n- The Angas and Upangas were orally passed down for a long time. According to historian R.C. Majumdar, a famine in South Bihar in the late fourth century BC led to an exodus of a section of Jains, led by **Bhadrabahu**, to South India. Those who remained in Pataliputra held a council and compiled the twelve Angas. Another council at **Valabhi** in Gujarat in the fifth or sixth century AD created a final collection of the scriptures in **Ardhmagadhi Prakrit** language.\n- The Angas are the most important part of Jain doctrines, discussing religious rites, stages of a householder's life, vows of chastity, and rules of conduct.\n\n**(ii) Tripitikas:**\n- The **Tripitikas** are the most important literary works of the Buddhists. The word means **'Three Baskets'** of Buddhist canon. The name comes from the practice of writing on long, narrow leaves, which were sewn together, bound in bunches, and stored in baskets.\n- These works are written in the **Pali language** and include:\n  - **The Vinaya Pitaka:** Deals with the rules and regulations for monks (**bhikkhus**) and nuns (**bhikkhunis**). It also contains accounts of the life and teachings of Buddha, and aspects of ancient Indian history and culture.\n  - **The Sutta Pitaka:** Comprises the discourses of Buddha and some of his disciples like Sariputta and Ananda. The **Dhammapada** (way of truth), a component of this Pitaka, contains Buddha's teachings.\n  - **The Abhidhamma Pitaka:** Deals with Buddhist philosophy, describing the working of the human mind and the state of matter.\n- The Tripitakas are a reliable source on Buddhist religion and philosophy and provide a glimpse into the social, economic, and political life of the age of Buddha.\n\n**(iii) Jatakas:**\n- The **Jatakas** are tales describing the previous births of Buddha in both human and animal forms.\n- Each tale begins by explaining the occasion of its telling and ends with the Buddha identifying the people in the story with people from his past. The future Buddha may appear as a king, an outcast, a god, or an elephant, always exhibiting a virtue.\n- Many Jataka tales have parallels in the Mahabharata and are precursors to the legendary biographies of the Buddha. They are frequently illustrated in Buddhist sculpture and painting.\n- The Jatakas shed light on the political, economic, and social conditions from the fifth to the second century BC and reflect Buddhist morals, ethics, and principles."

      "title": "Causes for the Rise of Jainism and Buddhism",
      "level_label": "Section",
      "content_md": "The following factors favoured the rise and growth of Jainism and Buddhism:\n\n1.  **Reaction against Ritualism:** Religious ceremonies had become very expensive and beyond the reach of ordinary people. This led to the rise of simpler, inexpensive faiths.\n\n2.  **Corruption in Religion:** Priests encouraged people to perform expensive **yajnas** and household rites to increase their own wealth. Kshatriya rulers protested this dominance. Both Jainism and Buddhism were founded by Kshatriya princes.\n\n3.  **Rigid Caste System:** The society was rigidly divided into **Brahmans, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, and Shudras**, with no social mobility. There were restrictions based on caste for food, drinks, and marriage.\n\n4.  **Difficult Language:** Most Vedic literature was in **Sanskrit**, a sacred language that common people found difficult to understand. People sought alternative religions with simpler languages.\n\n5.  **Political Situation:** In the sixth century BC, rulers of Magadha like **Bimbisara** and **Ajatashatru** were liberal, tolerant, and free from Brahmanic influence. They condemned social evils and patronised both Jainism and Buddhism.\n\n6.  **Agricultural Economy:** The killing of animals in sacrifices was against the interests of farmers in the Gangetic valley, who used animal-drawn ploughs. Both Jainism and Buddhism preached **non-violence** and opposed animal sacrifices."

His father was the chief of a Kshatriya clan, and his mother **Trishala** belonged to the royal family of the Lichchavis.\n- **Names:** For his bravery, he was called **Mahavira**. As his father's kingdom was prosperous at his birth, he was called **Vardhamana** (Prosperity).\n- **Renunciation:** He was absorbed in spiritual pursuits from childhood. He was married to **Yashoda**. At the age of thirty, after his parents' death, he renounced the world and practiced severe penance for 12 years.\n- **Enlightenment and Preaching:** He attained supreme knowledge and became **Jina** or the conqueror. His followers became known as **Jinas** or **Jains**. After becoming the Jina, he spent his life preaching. He gave his first sermon at **Mount Vipul** in Rajgriha. He was now a **Kevalin** (all-knowing). He preached at various centers like Avanti, Kosala, Anga, Mithila, Champa, Videha, and Vaishali.\n- **Salvation:** Lord Mahavira attained salvation at the age of 72 at **Pavapuri** in Bihar. At the time of his death, he had about 14,000 followers.\n\n[Image: Bhutanese painting showing Jataka Tales]"

      "level_label": "Topic",
      "content_md": "Jainism did not accept the authority of the Vedas. It preaches five vows, with the fifth being added by Mahavira.\n\n1.  **The Five Vows:** A Jain householder has to take the following five vows:\n    -   (i) **Ahimsa:** non-violence.\n    -   (ii) **Achaurya** or **Asteya:** not stealing.\n    -   (iii) **Satya:** not telling a lie.\n    -   (iv) **Aparigraha:** not possessing property.\n    -   (v) **Brahmacharya:** practising chastity.\n\nThe most important precept is that the entire world is animated, including stones, rocks, and water. Non-injury to all living beings is crucial. According to Mahavira, violence is of three kinds:\n    -   **(a) Physical violence:** killing, causing injury or pain.\n    -   **(b) Violence in words:** harsh language.\n    -   **(c) Mental violence:** ill-will towards others.\n\n2.  **Nine Truths:** Jains are expected to have knowledge of the nine truths, which is essential for salvation through renunciation. These nine truths are central to Jain philosophy:\n    -   **Jiva** (living things), **Ajiva** (non-living things), **Punya** (results of good deeds), **Pap** (sin), **Ashrav** (good deeds), **Sanvar** (hindrances in the way of karma), **Bandha** (bondage), **Nirjara** (destruction of karmas), and **Moksha** (salvation)."

      "content_md": "[Image: Symbol of Jainism]\n\n**(i) Tri-ratnas:** Mahavira taught that the ultimate goal is to attain **'moksha'** (freedom from worldly bonds). This can be achieved by following the **tri-ratnas** or three jewels:\n- **(a) right faith**\n- **(b) right knowledge**\n- **(c) right conduct**\nThese inspire a Jain to have faith in the 24 Tirthankaras, acquire knowledge from their sermons, and lead a good life.\n\n**(ii) Karma:** Jains believe in the Karma theory, where one is responsible for one's own actions. Good deeds liberate a person from the cycle of life and death.\n\n**(iii) Equality:** Mahavira stressed equality between all people, regardless of gender or caste. He preached universal brotherhood and believed that virtuous deeds could lead to ultimate salvation or **nirvana**. Compassion should be shown to all living beings.\n\n**(iv) Eternal soul:** Mahavira believed in the immortality of the soul (**atma**), stating that the body dies but the soul does not.\n\n**(v) Salvation:** Jains believe in **Moksha** (Salvation), freedom from the cycle of births and rebirths. It is achieved by leading an austere life based on non-violence, self-denial, and the practice of the tri-ratnas.\n\n**(vi) Belief in Penance:** Jainism emphasizes severe penance. To die of starvation, called **santhara** or **sallekhana**, was considered a virtue. This stress on austerity limited the number of its followers."

They remained in Magadha, wore white clothes, and covered their faces with a cloth to avoid harming insects. They fasted but did not believe in extreme austerity.\n-   **(b) Digambaras:** Followers of Bhadrabahu, they were 'sky-clad' and did not wear clothes, signifying detachment from worldly pleasures. They were orthodox followers of Mahavira, kept long fasts, and led an austere life.\n\n[Image: Tirthankaras]"

Consequently, Jains did not try to build a political empire.\n-   **(b) Social and Religious Impact:** Jainism discarded casteism, shunned rituals, and promoted social service.\n-   **(c) Language and Literature:** Jain scholars made significant literary contributions. Texts were written in **Prakrit** and local languages, finally compiled at Valabhi in Gujarat in the 6th century AD. Notable works include:\n    -   The **Angas** (teachings of Mahavira)\n    -   **Mahapurana** by Jinasena\n    -   **Kalpasutra** by Bhadrabahu\n    -   **Ratna Malika** by the Rashtrakuta ruler, Amoghavarsha\n    Jain literature, in **Ardhmagadhi** and **Prakrit** dialects, highlights the value of **ahimsa** and helps reconstruct Indian history from the 6th to 4th century BC.\n-   **(d) Art and Architecture:** Jains built temples and monasteries.

The world is full of suffering.\n  2.  The suffering has a cause.\n  3.  Desire is the cause of suffering.\n  4.  If desire is stopped, suffering can also be stopped.\n\n- **Eightfold Path (Ashtangika Marg):** Also known as the **middle path**, this is the way to **nirvana**. It is a path midway between luxurious living and hard penance. It includes:\n  1.  **Right action:** To remain away from theft, luxuries, and violence.\n  2.  **Right thought:** To remain away from empty rituals and worldly evils.\n  3.  **Right belief:** To give up desire.\n  4.  **Right living:** Not to have dishonest dealings with others.\n  5.  **Right speech:** Speak the truth and do not think ill of others.\n  6.  **Right effort:** Work for deliverance from sins and for the welfare of others.\n  7.  **Right recollection:** Think about pious things.\n  8.  **Right meditation:** Concentrate on only what is right.\n\n- **Attitude towards God:** Buddha taught that the universe was controlled by **Dharma**, a universal law. He was silent about God's existence but emphasised **non-violence**.\n\n- **Code of Conduct:** Buddha formulated a code for his followers:\n  - Not to tell a lie.\n  - Not to own property.\n  - Not to consume alcoholic drinks.\n  - Not to commit violence.\n  - Not to indulge in corrupt practices.\n\n- **Karma:** Buddhism believed in the theory of Karma and rebirth. Man is the maker of his destiny. Karma decides a person's existence in the next life, known as the **wheel of Existence**.\n\n- **Stress on Morality:** Buddha insisted on a life based on good actions, non-violence, and righteousness.\n\n- **Nirvana:** The ultimate goal of life is to attain **Nirvana** or salvation, a peaceful state free from the cycle of birth and death.\n\n- **Universal Brotherhood:** Lord Buddha preached the universal brotherhood of mankind, inviting people of all classes and races to join Buddhism and live in peace.\n\n- **No Faith in Rituals and Sacrifices:** Buddha taught that **yajnas** and rituals are empty ceremonies and cannot change a person's destiny.\n\n- **Ahimsa:** Like Mahavira, Buddha emphasized the sanctity of life and followed the path of non-violence."
