      "content_md": "The southern part of the Indian peninsula, south of the Krishna river, was inhabited by the **Dravidians**, with powerful kingdoms like the **Cheras**, the **Pandyas**, and the **Cholas**. The Chola Empire arose in the ninth century, developing a powerful navy that enabled sea trade, and the conquest of Sri Lanka and the Maldive Islands. By the end of the 9th century, the Cholas defeated the Pallavas of Kanchi and weakened the Pandyans, bringing the Tamil country (**Tondamandala**) under their control."

Another set contains 31 copper sheets in Sanskrit and Tamil, recording a grant to a temple by **Rajendra Chola I**.\n*   **Stone inscriptions:** The **Kanyakumari** stone inscription provides a long list of rulers.\n*   **Inscriptions on temple walls and pillars.**\n\n**Information from Inscriptions:**\n1.  **Chola administration:** The **Uttaramerur inscription** gives information on village administration, taxation, and land revenue.\n2.  **Gifts and endowments:** They record gifts to temples and brahmanas. Copper-plate inscriptions are records of grants of villages, land, or other privileges. The **Leyden grant** of Parantaka Chola is an example.\n3.  **Temple construction:** They inform about the construction of a temple or the setting up of a new image of a deity.\n4.  **Royal orders and judgements:** Some inscriptions contain royal orders on taxation, resolutions of village assemblies, and judgements against criminals.\n5.  **Public registrations:** Inscriptions on temple walls served as records of sales, mortgages, and other property transfers in village lands."

Indian merchants trading through the Straits of Malacca faced problems from the kingdom of **Shrivijaya** (modern Indonesia). At their request, Rajendra Chola sent a large navy, defeated the Shrivijaya king, and secured Indian trade with South-East Asia and southern China, greatly enriching the Chola kingdom.\n\n[Image: Vimana of Brihadeshwara Temple]"

These councils discussed the life and work of the villages. All affairs concerning the village, such as tax collection, dispute settlement, and water allocation, were handled by these committees.\n\n**Role of Temples in Administration and Society:**\n*   The temple was the center of social activity.\n*   Some temples owned huge lands (**devadaya** or **devadana**) and participated in trade.\n*   Land revenue of some villages was assigned to temples, making them major employers.\n*   Temples cared for their workers by providing food, clothing, housing, education, and hospitals.\n*   The temple was also a centre for education, with priests acting as local teachers. Schools were housed in the temple courtyard, and students learned in **Sanskrit** and **Tamil**."

Early Chola temples were simple, but later ones became bigger and more grand.\n\nThe art of making stone and metal images progressed rapidly. The Cholas excelled in creating images of gods and goddesses. The bronze image of Lord Shiva as **‘Nataraja’—Lord of Dance**, is an excellent work of art and has been described as the “cultural epitome” of the Chola period.\n\n[Image: Nataraja]"
