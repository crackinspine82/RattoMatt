However, the suspension of judicial remedy (R) is a distinct procedural step that the President *may* take by a separate order; it is not the cause or legal reason for the suspension of Article 19 freedoms (A).

This makes Certiorari the correct writ for the first situation. The Writ of Prohibition is incorrect here because it is issued 'when certain proceedings are going on', not after an order is passed. Second, an individual has been 'unlawfully detained'. The text defines Habeas Corpus ('to have the body') as the writ used to 'get the body of any person released if it has been unlawfully detained'.

The cartoon's key elements are the usurpation of a public office and the court's query 'By what authority?'. This directly corresponds to the definition of the Writ of Quo-warranto, which means 'by what order' and is issued when a person has usurped an office. The banner 'Checking Arbitrary State Actions' links this judicial power to the principle that Fundamental Rights (and their remedies) act as a check on the State. Article 13(2) provides for judicial review of laws and executive orders inconsistent with Fundamental Rights, which is the foundational principle for such checks. Option C correctly identifies the specific writ and connects it to the appropriate underlying constitutional doctrine mentioned in the text. The other options describe different writs with incorrect applications or link them to less relevant principles in this specific context."

State government'. The domicile requirement is a clear violation of this principle.\n- Statement III is a violation: The prohibition on forming unions directly contravenes the 'Freedom to form associations and unions' guaranteed under Article 19.\n- Statement IV is incorrect: The text explicitly states that under Preventive Detention, a person 'can be kept in custody for a period of three months without trial' as a 'precautionary measure'. The government also followed the procedure by informing him that grounds would be provided. Therefore, while the detention is harsh, the procedure described in the scenario does not violate the specific rules for Preventive Detention as laid out in the source text.

The text lists under Fundamental Duties in Article 51-A: '(c) to uphold and protect the sovereignty, unity and integrity of India'. However, R is not the correct explanation for A. Single Citizenship was an original feature of the Constitution, designed by the framers to 'ward off separatist tendencies and promote fraternity and unity'. The Fundamental Duties, including Article 51-A, were added much later by the 42nd Amendment Act in 1976. Therefore, the constitutional feature of Single Citizenship is not a 'consequence' of the Fundamental Duty. While both share the objective of promoting national unity, the duty is an obligation on citizens that reinforces an ideal, not the legal or historical cause for the structural provision of Single Citizenship."

Article 15 targets discrimination, Article 17 targets untouchability, and Article 18 targets hereditary titles. Option (d), the Right to Information, is an implied right under the Right to Freedom (Article 19). Its primary purpose is to ensure transparency and accountability of the government, which is functionally different from the anti-discrimination and equality-promoting purpose of the other three options.",

(iii) The fundamental duty regarding education (clause k) was added by the 86th Amendment Act in 2002, however, the question refers to the act itself. To avoid confusion with the RTI Act date, let's re-evaluate the question wording for clarity. Let's assume the order is based on the Acts mentioned. The text gives dates: Constitution commencement (Jan 26, 1950), 86th Amendment (2002), Citizenship Amendment (2003), RTI Act (2005). The correct order of events is (ii) 1950 -> (iii) 2002 -> (iv) 2003 -> (i) 2005. So the correct sequence should be (ii), (iii), (iv), (i). Let's re-verify the options. Ah, option (c) is (ii), (iii), (iv), (i). My model answer should be (c). Let me correct this.  Wait, the prompt asks me to generate questions. I can fix my own question. Let me reformulate to make it clearer and less error-prone in my own logic. \n\nLet's retry Question 2 to be very clear. \nEvents:\n(i) The Right to Information Act came into force.

The sequence is (ii), (iii), (iv), (i).\n\nNew Question 2:\nArrange the following legal and constitutional milestones in their correct chronological sequence:\n(i) The Right to Information Act came into force.\n(ii) The Constitution of Independent India commenced.\n(iii) The Right to Education was added as a fundamental right via an amendment.\n(iv) The Citizenship (Amendment) Act was passed, granting dual citizenship to certain PIOs.\n\n(a) (i), (ii), (iv), (iii)\n(b) (ii), (iii), (iv), (i)\n(c) (ii), (iv), (iii), (i)\n(d) (iii), (ii), (i), (iv)\n\nModel Answer: (b). Logic: The correct sequence is based on the dates of these events: (ii) The Constitution commenced on January 26, 1950. (iii) The Right to Education was added by the 86th Amendment Act in 2002. (iv) The Citizenship (Amendment) Act was passed in 2003. (i) The Right to Information Act came into force on October 12, 2005. Therefore, the correct chronological order is (ii), (iii), (iv), (i).

Option B is incorrect because the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2003 grants an exception (dual citizenship for PIOs) to the principle of Single Citizenship, rather than establishing its primary framework. Options C and D are incorrect as they pair a Fundamental Right with a law (Preventive Detention Act, National Security Act) that imposes restrictions on fundamental rights, representing an inverse relationship to the one in the stem."

Option A, 'Excess of jurisdiction', is incorrect; this is addressed by the Writ of Prohibition. Option B, 'Failure to perform a public duty', is incorrect; this is addressed by the Writ of Mandamus.

The provided text explicitly states that the 'Right to Information' is an 'implied Fundamental Right' which is 'implicit in the Right to Freedom of Speech and Expression (Article 19)'. We must find a similar relationship for the 'Right to Life and Personal Liberty' (Article 21).\n- Option (A) is incorrect. The right against self-incrimination is an explicit protection guaranteed under Article 20, not an implied right derived from Article 21.\n- Option (B) is correct. The text states the Supreme Court confirmed the 'Right to Privacy' as a fundamental right that 'can be derived from Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution'. Its connection to personal choices and autonomy links it strongly to Article 21, fitting the analogy of a judicially derived right from an explicit one.\n- Option (C) is incorrect. The 'Right to Education' is an explicit right added to the Constitution as Article 21A by an amendment, not an implied right derived from Article 21 through judicial interpretation.\n- Option (D) is incorrect. The 'Right to assemble peacefully' is one of the six explicit freedoms guaranteed under Article 19 itself."

Justify this statement by explaining the concept of 'reasonable restrictions', citing two specific legislative acts that impose such restrictions, and detailing the constitutional provision for its complete suspension.",
          "model_answer_text": "The statement is justified because the Constitution itself provides for limitations on the Right to Freedom for the greater good of the society and the nation.\n\n1.  **Reasonable Restrictions:** The freedoms under Article 19 can be subjected to 'reasonable restrictions' by the State. These restrictions are imposed on grounds of protecting the security of the State and national interest. They are meant to prevent arbitrary use of freedom that could harm public order.\n\n2.  **Legislative Restrictions:** Parliament has passed several laws that impose restrictions on the Right to Freedom. Two such examples are:\n    a)  **Preventive Detention Act (PDA)** or **National Security Act 1980 (NSA)**.\n    b)  **Essential Services Maintenance Act (ESMA)**.\n\n3.  **Constitutional Suspension:** The freedoms guaranteed under Article 19 can be completely suspended when the President of India declares a state of Emergency under Article 352, in case of war, external aggression, or armed rebellion. This suspension is temporary and lasts only for the duration of the Emergency.",

This is irrespective of their economic status, caste, colour, creed, religion, or sex.\n\n(b) Article 17 of the Constitution abolishes 'untouchability' and forbids its practice in any form. The enforcement of any disability arising out of 'untouchability' shall be an offence punishable in accordance with law. For example, preventing a person from entering a place of public worship or using a public well is a punishable offence.\n\n(c) Article 18 abolishes all titles like 'Maharaja', 'Rai Sahib', and 'Khan Bahadur'. This provision was included because such titles are considered a negation of the principle of equal status for all citizens. However, titles given for meritorious public service (like 'Bharat Ratna'), or honours in the fields of military service, sports, or academics are exempted. These are not considered titles of nobility but recognitions of merit and service to the nation.",

This replaced the 'communal electorate' system provided under the British Acts of 1919 and 1935, where people of a particular community could only vote for candidates from their own community.\n\n(c) The Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2003 granted 'dual citizenship' to all Persons of Indian Origin (PIOs) who had migrated to other countries after January 26, 1950.

          "model_answer_text": "(a) The purpose of the writs are as follows:\n1.  **Habeas Corpus**: Its literal meaning is 'to have the body'. This writ is issued by the Supreme Court or a High Court to get the body of any person released if they have been unlawfully detained. It is a great safeguard for the personal freedom of a citizen.\n2.  **Mandamus**: Its literal meaning is 'we order'. It is a command from a superior court to a lower court or an administrative authority to perform a certain duty.\n\n(b) The main difference between the Writ of Prohibition and the Writ of Certiorari is the stage at which they are issued:\n*   **Writ of Prohibition**: It is issued by a superior court to a lower court to stop proceedings in a case which might be in excess of the jurisdiction of the lower court. It is issued when the proceedings are still going on.\n*   **Writ of Certiorari**: It is issued by a superior court to a judicial authority after an order has already been passed by the lower court, desiring 'to be informed of what is going on'.\nThus, Prohibition is preventive, while Certiorari is curative.\n\n(c) (i) The Fundamental Duties are listed in **Article 51-A** of the Constitution. They were added by the **42nd Amendment Act, 1976**.\n(ii) Any three Fundamental Duties are:\n1.  To abide by the Constitution and respect its ideals and institutions, the National Flag and the National Anthem.\n2.  To uphold and protect the sovereignty, unity and integrity of India.\n3.  To develop the scientific temper, humanism and the spirit of inquiry and reform.",

          "question_text": "With reference to the Fundamental Rights guaranteed by the Indian Constitution, answer the following:\n(a) Explain the concept of an 'implied Fundamental Right' with specific reference to the Right to Information (RTI). How is the Right to Privacy derived, according to the Supreme Court? [3]\n(b) Differentiate between the system of 'joint electorate' adopted by the Constitution of Independent India and the 'communal electorate' system that preceded it. What is the main objective of the joint electorate system? [3]\n(c) The Right to Freedom under Article 19 is not absolute. Differentiate between the 'suspension' of this right during a Proclamation of Emergency and the 'reasonable restrictions' that can be imposed in normal times. Provide two examples of specific legislations that impose such restrictions. [4]",
          "model_answer_text": "(a) An 'implied Fundamental Right' is a right that is not explicitly named in the Constitution but is considered a part of a named Fundamental Right because it partakes of the same basic nature and character. The Right to Information (RTI) is an implied Fundamental Right derived from the Right to Freedom of Speech and Expression (Article 19), as one cannot speak freely without knowing the facts. According to the Supreme Court, the Right to Privacy is also a fundamental right derived from Articles 14, 19, and 21 of the Constitution.\n\n(b) The 'communal electorate' system, which existed under the Acts of 1919 and 1935, involved voters of a particular community voting exclusively for candidates of their own community. In contrast, the 'joint electorate' system, introduced by the Constitution of Independent India, requires all resident voters of a constituency to vote for the same candidate, irrespective of the voter's or candidate's caste or creed. The main objective of the joint electorate system is to curb communal politics and foster communal harmony.\n\n(c) The difference lies in their scope, duration, and trigger:\n**Suspension during Emergency:** This is a complete but temporary suspension of the rights under Article 19. It occurs only when a Proclamation of Emergency is made by the President under Article 352 (due to war, external aggression, or armed rebellion). During this period, the executive and legislature can take actions that violate these freedoms without judicial challenge. The rights are restored once the emergency is over.\n**Reasonable Restrictions:** These are permanent limitations, not a complete suspension, imposed by law even in normal times. They are meant to balance individual liberty with public good, such as the security of the State, public order, and morality. The Constitution empowers the State to enact laws that impose these restrictions. Two examples of such legislations are the Essential Services Maintenance Act (ESMA) and the Preventive Detention Act (PDA).",

In this context, answer the following:\n(a) Explain the protections available to a citizen under Article 20 in respect of conviction for offences. [3]\n(b) Define 'Preventive Detention'. Differentiate the rights of a person arrested under ordinary circumstances from those of a person detained under Preventive Detention, specifically regarding the duration of custody without trial. [3]\n(c) Differentiate between the writs of 'Prohibition' and 'Certiorari', focusing on the stage at which they are issued. For what specific purpose is the writ of 'Quo-warranto' issued by a superior court? [4]",
          "model_answer_text": "(a) Under Article 20, a citizen is granted three key protections in respect of conviction for offences:\n(i) Protection against a greater penalty than what is prescribed by the law in force at the time the offence was committed.\n(ii) Protection from being prosecuted and punished for the same offence more than once (double jeopardy).\n(iii) Protection against self-incrimination, meaning a person cannot be compelled to be a witness in a case where they themselves are the accused.\n\n(b) 'Preventive Detention' is not a punishment for a crime but a precautionary measure where a person is detained to prevent them from committing a potential offence. \nThe key difference in rights is:\n**Arrest under ordinary circumstances:** An arrested person has the right to be informed of the grounds of arrest, to consult a lawyer, and to be produced before a magistrate within 24 hours.\n**Detention under Preventive Detention:** A person can be kept in custody for a period of up to three months without trial. Detention beyond three months requires approval from an Advisory Board. The detainee has the right to be informed of the grounds of detention and to make a representation against the detention order.\n\n(c) The key difference between the writs of Prohibition and Certiorari lies in the timing of their issuance:\n**Writ of Prohibition:** This writ is issued by a superior court to a lower court to *stop proceedings* that are currently *in progress*. It is a preventive measure used when a lower court is acting in excess of its jurisdiction.\n**Writ of Certiorari:** This writ is issued by a superior court to a judicial authority *after an order has already been passed*. Its purpose is to quash the order if the lower court has acted illegally or without jurisdiction. Thus, Prohibition is issued during proceedings, while Certiorari is issued after proceedings have concluded.\n\nThe writ of **Quo-warranto** (meaning 'by what order') is issued to prevent a person from forcibly or wrongly holding a high public office that they have usurped. It challenges the legality of their claim to that office.",

          "model_answer_text": "(a) The six basic freedoms guaranteed under Article 19 are:\n1. Freedom of speech and expression.\n2. Freedom to assemble peacefully without arms.\n3. Freedom to form associations and unions.\n4. Freedom to move freely throughout India.\n5. Freedom to reside and settle in any part of India.\n6. Freedom to practise any profession, trade or business.\n\n(b) An implied Fundamental Right is one which is a part of a named Fundamental Right or partakes of the same basic nature and character. The Right to Information (RTI) is considered an implied Fundamental Right because it is implicit in the Right to Freedom of Speech and Expression (Article 19). The rationale is that if one does not know the facts, one cannot speak freely. The Right to Information Act came into force on October 12, 2005.\n\n(c) Four significant limitations on the Right to Freedom are:\n1. **Suspension during Emergency:** Under Article 352, when the President declares a state of Emergency, the freedoms guaranteed under Article 19 can be suspended.\n2. **Reasonable Restrictions:** The State can impose reasonable restrictions on these freedoms in the interest of the security of the State and national interest.\n3. **Specific Parliamentary Laws:** Parliament can enact laws that restrict these freedoms for specific purposes. Examples include the Preventive Detention Act and the Essential Services Maintenance Act (ESMA), which ensures the delivery of essential services.\n4. **Prescribing Qualifications:** For the freedom to practise any profession, the State can make laws to prescribe minimum educational, technical, or other qualifications for entry to a certain profession or trade.",

[3]\n(b) The Right to Constitutional Remedies is fundamental to the realisation of all other rights. In this context, differentiate between the Writ of Prohibition and the Writ of Certiorari.

          "model_answer_text": "(a) The 'Abolition of Untouchability' under Article 17 means that the practice of untouchability in any form is abolished and its practice is made a punishable offence by law. Two specific practices that are punishable are:\n1. Preventing a person from entering a place of public worship.\n2. Preventing a person from using a public well or a public transport system.\n\n(b) The difference between the Writ of Prohibition and the Writ of Certiorari is as follows:\n*   **Writ of Prohibition:** This writ is issued by a superior court to a lower court to stop proceedings in a case which might be in excess of the jurisdiction of the lower court. Crucially, it is issued while the proceedings are still going on.\n*   **Writ of Certiorari:** This writ, meaning \"to be informed of what is going on,\" is issued by a superior court to a judicial authority after an order has already been passed by the lower court. \nThe key difference lies in the timing: Prohibition is preventive (stops ongoing proceedings), while Certiorari is curative (reviews an order already passed).\n\n(c) The Fundamental Rights serve as a check on the arbitrary actions of the State in two primary ways:\n1. **Judicial Review under Article 13(2):** This Article declares that any law or executive order inconsistent with the Fundamental Rights shall be void. This provision empowers the judiciary to review and invalidate any legislation that infringes upon these rights, thus placing a limitation on the legislative and executive powers of the State.\n2. **Enforcement through Writs:** The Right to Constitutional Remedies allows citizens to move the courts to enforce their rights. The Writ of Habeas Corpus, meaning 'to have the body', is a powerful tool in this regard. By issuing this writ, the Supreme Court or a High Court can command the State to produce a detained person and can order their release if the detention is found to be unlawful. This serves as a direct and immediate safeguard for the personal freedom of a citizen against illegal arrest or detention by the State.",

According to the Citizenship (Amendment) Act 2003, who are these people and what is the key political right they cannot enjoy?

To ward off separatist tendencies.\n2. To promote fraternity and unity among the people.\n\n(c) The Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2003 has granted dual citizenship to all Persons of Indian Origin (PIOs), who migrated to other countries after January 26, 1950. The key political right they cannot enjoy is the right to vote.\n\n(d) Three Fundamental Duties that reflect the spirit of unity are:\n(i) (Article 51-A(c)) to uphold and protect the sovereignty, unity and integrity of India;\n(ii) (Article 51-A(e)) to promote harmony and the spirit of common brotherhood amongst all the people of India transcending religious, linguistic and regional or sectional diversities;\n(iii) (Article 51-A(f)) to value and preserve the rich heritage of our composite culture.",

          "model_answer_text": "(a) The right being exercised is the Right to Vote. The constitutional principle is Universal Adult Franchise, which means that all persons of 18 years of age and above have the right to vote irrespective of their caste, colour, religion, etc.\n\n(b) The 'communal electorate' system, provided under the British Acts of 1919 and 1935, meant that voters of a particular community would vote for candidates from their own community only. The 'joint electorate' system, adopted by independent India, requires all resident voters of a constituency to vote for the same candidate irrespective of his caste or creed. This was done to curb communal politics.\n\n(c) Article 16 provides for equality of opportunity for all citizens in matters relating to employment in an office under the Central or State government. It prohibits any sort of discrimination on grounds of religion, caste, sex, etc. However, it also allows the state to make laws for the reservation of posts in favour of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and Other Backward Classes (OBCs).\n\n(d) In constituencies reserved for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, while the candidates must belong to these specific communities, all people from such constituencies, irrespective of their own caste or tribe, have to vote for the same candidates. This upholds the principle of joint electorate.",

Explain two primary objectives behind the adoption of this feature by the Constituent Assembly. [3]\n\n(b) The ballot box signifies a core democratic principle introduced in independent India, replacing a divisive system from the colonial era. Name this principle. Differentiate the system it established from the 'communal electorate' system prevalent under the Acts of 1919 and 1935. [3]\n\n(c) The gavel symbolises equality and justice. Name the specific Fundamental Right guaranteed under Article 14 that embodies this. Citing one specific provision from each, explain how Article 15 and Article 16 serve as extensions of the principle of equality into social and economic spheres. [4]",
          "model_answer_text": "(a) The feature is Single Citizenship.\nThe two primary objectives for its adoption were:\n1. To ward off separatist tendencies and prevent the growth of narrow, regional loyalties over national identity.\n2. To promote a sense of fraternity and unity among all people of India, reinforcing the idea that every Indian, regardless of their place of birth or residence, is a citizen of India first.\n\n(b) The principle is Universal Adult Franchise.\nThis principle established a system of 'joint electorate'. This is fundamentally different from the 'communal electorate' system under the British Acts of 1919 and 1935. Under the communal electorate, voters of a specific religious community could only vote for candidates from their own community. In contrast, the joint electorate system mandates that all resident voters of a constituency, irrespective of their religion, caste, or creed, vote for the same candidate. This was done to curb communal politics and foster harmony.\n\n(c) The Fundamental Right under Article 14 is 'Equality before Law'. It guarantees that all citizens are equal in the eyes of the law and are entitled to its equal protection.\n- **Article 15** extends this principle into the social sphere by prohibiting the state from discriminating against any citizen on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth, particularly in matters like access to public places or admission to educational institutions.\n- **Article 16** extends this principle into the economic sphere of public employment by providing for equality of opportunity for all citizens in matters relating to employment or appointment to any office under the State. It prohibits discrimination on the same grounds for government jobs.",

Based on this, answer the following:\n\n(a) The act in scene (i) is an exercise of an 'implied' Fundamental Right derived from Article 19. Identify this right and the Act that gives it statutory force. Explain the constitutional reasoning for why it is considered an 'implied' part of the Right to Freedom of Speech and Expression. [3]\n\n(b) With reference to scene (ii), define 'Preventive Detention'. State the procedure for extending such a detention beyond three months, mentioning the specific body involved in the process and its composition. [3]\n\n(c) Scene (iii) depicts the suspension of rights. Under what specific constitutional provision can the Fundamental Rights guaranteed by Article 19 be suspended? Mention three other laws or grounds (besides an Emergency) that act as 'reasonable restrictions' on the Right to Freedom. [4]",
          "model_answer_text": "(a) The implied Fundamental Right is the Right to Information (RTI). The Act that enforces it is the Right to Information Act, 2005.\nIt is considered an 'implied' right because the Right to Freedom of Speech and Expression, guaranteed by Article 19, cannot be fully exercised without access to information. In order to form an informed opinion and express it freely, a citizen must have the right to know the facts and seek information from the government. Thus, RTI is implicit in, and a core component of, the freedom of speech.\n\n(b) 'Preventive Detention' means the detention of a person without trial, not as a punishment for a past offence, but as a precautionary measure to prevent them from committing an offence in the near future.\nDetention beyond three months can only be extended on the recommendation of an Advisory Board. This Advisory Board must be constituted for this purpose and must consist of a judge of the High Court.\n\n(c) The Fundamental Rights under Article 19 can be suspended when the President of India proclaims a state of Emergency under Article 352, on grounds of war, external aggression, or armed rebellion.\nThree other laws or grounds that act as 'reasonable restrictions' on the Right to Freedom are:\n1. Security of the State and national interest.\n2. Maintenance of public order and morality.\n3. Legislations passed by Parliament such as the Essential Services Maintenance Act (ESMA) or the National Security Act (NSA), which are enacted to safeguard national interests or ensure delivery of essential services.",

The left side shows a diverse group of people from different Indian states (identifiable by their traditional attire) proudly holding up Indian Passports. The right side depicts a person looking dejected after being handed a rejection letter for a Central Government job, with the reason explicitly stated as 'Not a resident of this State'.]\n\n(a) Identify and explain the salient feature of the Constitution highlighted in the left part of the image. How does this system differ from that prevailing in the USA? [3]\n\n(b) With reference to the right side of the image, identify the specific Fundamental Right that has been violated. State the relevant Article and explain how it prohibits such discrimination. [3]\n\n(c) The feature identified in (a) aims to promote national unity, while the Right identified in (b) guarantees equality. Explain how the provision for reservation for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and Other Backward Classes within the framework of this Right attempts to balance the principle of equality of opportunity with the objectives of social and economic equality. [4]",
          "model_answer_text": "(a) The feature highlighted is **Single Citizenship**. This means that all Indians, irrespective of the State of their domicile, are citizens of India only. They are not citizens of the State where they reside. This system differs from that in the USA, where a person can have dual citizenship – being a citizen of their State (e.g., New York State) as well as a citizen of the USA.\n\n(b) The Fundamental Right violated is the **Right to Equality of Opportunity** in matters of public employment, guaranteed under **Article-16** of the Constitution. Article-16 provides for equality of opportunity for all citizens in matters relating to employment in an office under the Central or State government. It prohibits any sort of discrimination on grounds of place of domicile (as mentioned in the chapter under Single Citizenship linking to Article 14 and 15 principles, which Article 16 builds on).\n\n(c) Single Citizenship promotes unity by preventing separatist tendencies based on regional identities. The Right to Equality of Opportunity under Article-16 reinforces this by ensuring citizens can seek government employment anywhere in India without discrimination. However, to achieve social and economic equality for historically disadvantaged communities, Article-16 also allows the state to make reservations of posts for **Scheduled Castes (15%)**, **Scheduled Tribes (7.5%)**, and **Other Backward Classes (27%)**. This provision acts as a balancing mechanism. While the general rule is equal opportunity for all, this exception ensures that marginalized sections are given special provisions to bring them on par with others, thereby harmonizing the ideal of equality with the practical need for social justice.",

Access to information held by the government is essential for forming an informed opinion and expressing it meaningfully.\n\n(c) Three distinct types of restrictions on the freedoms under Article 19 are:\n1.  **Suspension during Emergency**: Article-19 can be suspended when the President declares an Emergency.\n2.  **Reasonable Restrictions**: For the security of the State and in the national interest, reasonable restrictions can be imposed on the implementation of this right.\n3.  **Specific Legislations**: Parliament can enact laws that impose restrictions, such as the Preventive Detention Act or the Essential Services Maintenance Act (ESMA), to safeguard national interests or ensure the delivery of essential services.\n\n(d) **Difference between Writ of Prohibition and Writ of Certiorari**:\n*   The **Writ of Prohibition** is issued by a superior court to a lower court to **stop proceedings** in a case that is beyond the lower court's jurisdiction. It is issued while the proceedings are still going on.\n*   The **Writ of Certiorari** is issued by a superior court to a judicial authority **after an order has already been passed** by the lower court, with the aim of being informed of the proceedings and potentially quashing the order if it was passed without jurisdiction.",

Furthermore, during a proclamation of Emergency under Article 352, the freedoms guaranteed under Article 19 can be suspended altogether. This balance between individual liberty and state security is a key feature of the Indian constitutional framework. The Right to Information has been interpreted as an implied Fundamental Right, implicit in the Right to Freedom of Speech and Expression, because if one does not know the facts, one cannot speak freely.\n\n(a) Identify the Article of the Constitution that guarantees the six basic freedoms mentioned in the passage. [1]\n(b) Explain the term 'implied Fundamental Right' with reference to the Right to Information (RTI). [2]\n(c) Differentiate between the 'suspension of Fundamental Rights' during an Emergency and the imposition of 'reasonable restrictions' on them. [3]\n(d) Based on the passage and your understanding of the chapter, explain why the Constitution, while granting fundamental freedoms, also provides for their limitation. [4]",
          "model_answer_text": "(a) Article 19 of the Constitution guarantees the six basic freedoms.\n\n(b) An implied Fundamental Right is a right that is not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution but is considered an integral part of a named Fundamental Right. The Right to Information (RTI) is an implied right derived from the Right to Freedom of Speech and Expression (Article 19). This is because access to information is essential for a citizen to form an informed opinion and express it freely.\n\n(c) The key differences are:\n- **Context:** Suspension occurs only during a Proclamation of Emergency, while reasonable restrictions can be imposed even during normal times.\n- **Scope:** Suspension is a temporary but complete withdrawal of the right's enforceability (e.g., Article 19 is suspended). Reasonable restrictions are permanent, legally defined limitations that narrow the scope of the right but do not abolish it.\n- **Authority:** Suspension is enacted following a Presidential proclamation. Restrictions are imposed by the State (Parliament/legislatures) through specific laws.\n\n(d) The Constitution provides for limitations on fundamental freedoms because these rights are not absolute and must be balanced against the collective interests of society and the nation. These limitations are necessary for several reasons:\n1.  **To protect national security and sovereignty:** Unrestricted freedom could be misused to endanger the security and integrity of the State.\n2.  **To maintain public order:** Freedoms cannot be allowed to descend into chaos or disrupt the normal life of the people.\n3.  **To ensure the general welfare of the society:** The State can make laws for the public good, such as prescribing minimum qualifications for a profession, which might restrict the freedom to practise any profession.\n4.  **To prevent arbitrary use:** The restrictions ensure that one person's exercise of their right does not infringe upon the rights of others or harm the community.",

          "question_text": "Read the passage given below and answer the questions that follow:\n\nThe Indian Constitution is committed to establishing a just and egalitarian society. This commitment is reflected in the Fundamental Rights, particularly the Right to Equality (Articles 14-18) and the Right against Exploitation (Articles 23-24). Article 14 guarantees equality before the law, while subsequent articles prohibit discrimination on various grounds. Article 16 provides for equality of opportunity in public employment but also allows the state to make provisions for the reservation of posts in favour of backward classes. Article 17 takes a firm stand by abolishing 'untouchability'. The Right against Exploitation complements this by prohibiting forced labour and the employment of children below 14 years in hazardous industries, safeguarding human dignity against economic and social coercion. These provisions collectively aim to rectify historical injustices and ensure that every citizen can live a life of dignity.\n\n(a) State the two principles guaranteed under Article 14. [1]\n(b) Explain the purpose of Article 24 of the Constitution. [2]\n(c) Differentiate between the protections offered under Article 17 (Abolition of Untouchability) and Article 23 (Prohibition of forced labour). [3]\n(d) Article 16 guarantees 'equality of opportunity' but also permits 'reservation of posts'. Explain how these two seemingly contradictory ideas are reconciled to achieve the larger constitutional goal of social equality. [4]",
          "model_answer_text": "(a) The two principles guaranteed under Article 14 are (i) equality before law and (ii) equality in protection by law.\n\n(b) The purpose of Article 24 is to protect children from economic exploitation. It prohibits the employment of children below the age of 14 years in any factory, mine, or other hazardous occupations. It also declares the practice of bonded labour unlawful.\n\n(c) The key differences are:\n- **Target of Prohibition:** Article 17 targets a specific social evil—the practice of 'untouchability', which is a form of social discrimination based on caste. Article 23 targets economic exploitation in the form of slavery, beggary, trafficking, and other forms of forced labour.\n- **Nature of Right:** Article 17 aims to ensure social dignity and access to public spaces without discrimination. Article 23 aims to protect human dignity by preventing the commodification and forced servitude of individuals.\n- **Scope:** While both protect dignity, Article 17 deals with a specific, historically entrenched social disability, whereas Article 23 deals with broader forms of coercive labour practices.\n\n(d) The provision for 'reservation of posts' in Article 16 is not a contradiction to 'equality of opportunity' but rather a means to achieve it in a substantive sense. The reconciliation is based on the principle of positive discrimination or affirmative action.\n1.  **Correcting Historical Injustice:** The Constitution recognizes that certain communities (like SCs, STs, and OBCs) have been historically disadvantaged and discriminated against, preventing them from competing on an equal footing.\n2.  **Creating a Level Playing Field:** Formal equality (treating everyone the same) would be unjust in a society with deep-rooted inequalities. Reservations provide these disadvantaged groups with special opportunities to overcome their historical handicaps and ensure they have a fair chance at securing public employment.\n3.  **Achieving Substantive Equality:** The goal is not just formal equality but substantive or real equality. By providing reservations, the State aims to uplift marginalized sections and ensure their adequate representation, thereby achieving the broader constitutional goal of social and economic equality.",

This freedom is so wide that it includes the freedom of the Press, which is not explicitly mentioned. Furthermore, the Right to Information (RTI) is considered an implied Fundamental Right, implicit in the Right to Freedom of Speech and Expression, because if one does not know the facts, one cannot speak freely. However, these freedoms are not absolute. For the security of the State and national interest, reasonable restrictions can be imposed. During a proclamation of Emergency under Article 352, Article-19 can be suspended. Additionally, laws like the Essential Services Maintenance Act (ESMA) impose certain restrictions on the Right to Freedom to ensure the delivery of essential services which, if obstructed, would affect the normal life of the people.\n\n(i) Define an 'implied Fundamental Right' with reference to the passage. Which specific right mentioned in the passage is an example of this, and under which Article is it included? [3]\n(ii) The passage states that the Right to Freedom is \"not absolute\". Explain this statement by identifying and describing two distinct types of limitations mentioned in the passage, citing the specific constitutional provision for one of them. [3]\n(iii) Differentiate between the 'Writ of Prohibition' and the 'Writ of Certiorari' as remedies available for the enforcement of Fundamental Rights. On what grounds can the President suspend the right to move a court for the enforcement of these rights? [4]",
          "model_answer_text": "(i) An 'implied Fundamental Right' is defined as one which is a part of a named Fundamental Right or partakes of the same basic nature and character as that Fundamental Right. The Right to Information (RTI) is the example mentioned in the passage. It is included under Article 19(1) of the Constitution as it is implicit in the Right to Freedom of Speech and Expression.\n\n(ii) The statement \"not absolute\" means that the Right to Freedom can be restricted under certain conditions for the greater good of the nation. The two limitations mentioned are:\n1.  **Reasonable Restrictions:** The State can impose reasonable restrictions on the implementation of these rights for the security of the State and in the national interest. For instance, laws like ESMA can be enacted to ensure the delivery of essential services.\n2.  **Suspension during Emergency:** Article-19 can be suspended when the President declares a state of Emergency in the country under Article 352, in cases of war, external aggression or armed rebellion.\n\n(iii) **Difference between Writs:** The Writ of Prohibition is an order issued by a superior court to a lower court to *stop proceedings* in a case that is beyond the lower court's jurisdiction. It is issued while the proceedings are ongoing. In contrast, the Writ of Certiorari is issued by a superior court to a judicial authority after an *order has already been passed* by the lower court, with the aim of being informed about the proceedings, often to quash the said order.\n**Suspension of Remedies:** The President may, by Order, declare that the right to move a court for the enforcement of Fundamental Rights shall remain suspended when a proclamation of emergency is in operation. This renders the Supreme Court and High Courts powerless to issue writs for the enforcement of any fundamental right during the emergency period.",

          "question_text": "Read the passage carefully and answer the questions that follow:\n\nThe Indian Constitution is founded on the principle of equality. Article 14 guarantees equality before the law for all persons, while Article 16 provides for equality of opportunity for all citizens in matters of public employment. However, Article 16 also allows for the reservation of posts for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and Other Backward Classes to ensure social and economic equality. This principle of a unified nation is further strengthened by the provision for a Single Citizenship, meaning all Indians, irrespective of their State of domicile, are citizens of India. This was deliberately chosen over a dual citizenship system, like in the USA, to ward off separatist tendencies and promote national unity. An exception was made by the Citizenship (Amendment) Act 2003, granting dual citizenship to Persons of Indian Origin (PIOs) who migrated after January 26, 1950, though with certain limitations.\n\n(i) According to the passage, what is the primary purpose of providing for Single Citizenship in India? Identify one key limitation placed on Persons of Indian Origin (PIOs) who have been granted dual citizenship. [2]\n(ii) The passage mentions two distinct articles related to equality. Differentiate between the guarantees provided under Article 14 and Article 16 of the Constitution. [3]\n(iii) Article 16 provides for 'equality of opportunity' but also permits 'reservations'. Explain how these two seemingly contradictory provisions are reconciled within the constitutional framework to achieve 'social and economic equality'. Further, explain the constitutional mechanism that prevents the state from making arbitrary exceptions to Fundamental Rights, referencing Article 13(2). [5]",
          "model_answer_text": "(i) The primary purpose of providing for Single Citizenship is to ward off separatist tendencies and to promote fraternity and unity among the people of India. The key limitation placed on Persons of Indian Origin (PIOs) with dual citizenship is that they do not have the right to vote.\n\n(ii) **Article 14** guarantees 'equality before law' and 'equality in protection by law' to all persons, making any form of discrimination on grounds like economic status, caste, creed, religion, or sex a punishable offence. It is a general right of equality.\n**Article 16** specifically provides for 'equality of opportunity' for all *citizens* in matters relating to employment under the Central or State government. It prohibits discrimination on the same grounds as Article 14 but is focused on public employment.\n\n(iii) The provisions of 'equality of opportunity' and 'reservations' under Article 16 are reconciled by the understanding that formal equality (treating everyone the same) may not lead to substantive equality. Reservations are a form of affirmative action intended to correct historical injustices and provide a level playing field for socially and economically disadvantaged sections like SCs, STs, and OBCs. By allowing the state to make special provisions for these groups, the Constitution aims to achieve true social and economic equality, thus fulfilling the broader objective of the Right to Equality.\nThe constitutional mechanism that prevents arbitrary state action is **Judicial Review**, as implied in **Article 13(2)**. This article declares that any law or executive order inconsistent with the Fundamental Rights is void to the extent of the inconsistency. This empowers the judiciary to review legislation and strike down any law that arbitrarily violates Fundamental Rights, ensuring that any exceptions made by the state are valid and reasonable.",

          "question_text": "Read the passage given below and answer the questions that follow.\n\n_The Indian Constitution provides for a Single Citizenship. This means that all Indians irrespective of the State of their domicile are the citizens of India. This is unlike the system prevailing in the USA. This has been done to ward off separatist tendencies and promote fraternity and unity among the people. A person born in Punjab or in Kerala can only be a citizen of India and not a citizen of the State of their domicile as well. However, by the Citizenship (Amendment) Act 2003, the Government of India has granted dual citizenship to all the Persons of Indian Origin (PIOs), who migrated to other countries after January 26, 1950. All privileges of an Indian citizen except the right to vote could be enjoyed by PIOs._\n\n(a) According to the passage, what was the primary constitutional objective behind establishing the principle of Single Citizenship in India? [2]\n\n(b) Differentiate between the citizenship status of a Person of Indian Origin (PIO) under the 2003 Amendment and that of a citizen domiciled in an Indian State like Kerala. [4]\n\n(c) The provision of Single Citizenship aims to foster unity, while the 2003 Amendment grants 'dual citizenship' to PIOs. Analyse how these two seemingly contradictory provisions serve distinct purposes within the framework of Indian nationhood without undermining the core principle of single domestic citizenship. [4]",
          "model_answer_text": "(a) The primary constitutional objective behind establishing Single Citizenship was to ward off separatist tendencies and to promote fraternity and unity among the people of India.\n\n(b) The citizenship status of a Person of Indian Origin (PIO) and a citizen domiciled in Kerala can be differentiated as follows:\n*   **Nature of Citizenship:** A citizen domiciled in Kerala holds only a Single Citizenship, that of India. A PIO, under the 2003 Act, is granted dual citizenship, meaning they are a citizen of another country and also recognized by India.\n*   **Basis of Status:** The Kerala domiciled person is a citizen by birth/domicile within the territory of India. The PIO status is granted to those of Indian origin who migrated to other countries after January 26, 1950.\n*   **Political Rights:** A citizen domiciled in Kerala enjoys all rights, including the fundamental Right to Vote. A PIO, despite having other privileges, is explicitly excluded from the right to vote in India.\n*   **Allegiance:** The principle of single citizenship implies singular political allegiance to India for a person domiciled in Kerala. A PIO's status acknowledges their connection to India while they are citizens of another sovereign nation.\n\n(c) The provisions are not contradictory as they operate in different spheres and serve distinct purposes. \n*   **Single Citizenship (Internal Focus):** This principle applies **domestically** to all residents of India. Its purpose is to build an integrated Indian identity, prevent regional loyalties from overriding national identity, and counter fissiparous or separatist tendencies among people living within India's borders. It ensures that a citizen of Punjab has the same rights and identity as a citizen of Kerala, fostering national unity and fraternity.\n*   **Dual Citizenship for PIOs (External Focus):** This provision is directed **externally** towards the Indian diaspora. Its purpose is not to create internal division, but to maintain and strengthen the connection of Persons of Indian Origin with their ancestral homeland. It encourages cultural, social, and economic ties, leveraging the diaspora's resources and goodwill for national development, without granting them political power (like the right to vote) that could interfere with domestic governance. Therefore, it complements the goal of nation-building by engaging the global Indian community, while the principle of single citizenship secures the nation's internal cohesion.",

          "question_text": "Read the passage given below and answer the questions that follow.\n\n_Under Article-19, the Constitution guarantees six basic freedoms. The Right to Information (RTI) has been included in Article 19(1) of the Constitution. An implied Fundamental Right is one which is a part of a named Fundamental Right or partakes of the same basic nature. Since RTI is implicit in the Right to Freedom of Speech and Expression, it is an implied Fundamental Right. However, Fundamental Rights are not absolute. The security of the State and national interest being of paramount interest, reasonable restrictions could be imposed on the implementation of these rights. The Fundamental Rights can be suspended when the President declares a state of Emergency. Furthermore, legislations like the Essential Services Maintenance Act (ESMA) impose certain restrictions on the Right to Freedom to ensure the delivery of essential services._\n\n(a) With reference to the passage, define an 'implied Fundamental Right' and explain why the Right to Information is considered one. [3]\n\n(b) Distinguishing between a 'Writ of Prohibition' and a 'Writ of Certiorari', explain which of these is issued after an order has already been passed by a lower court. [3]\n\n(c) The passage states, \"Fundamental Rights are not absolute.\" In this context, describe three distinct types of limitations that can be imposed on the Fundamental Rights as mentioned in the provided chapter content. [4]",
          "model_answer_text": "(a) An 'implied Fundamental Right' is a right that is not explicitly named in the Constitution but is considered a part of a named Fundamental Right because it partakes of the same basic nature and character. The Right to Information (RTI) is considered an implied Fundamental Right because it is implicit in the Right to Freedom of Speech and Expression, guaranteed by Article 19. The logic is that one cannot speak or express oneself freely without having access to facts and information.\n\n(b) \n*   **Writ of Prohibition:** This is an order issued by a superior court to a lower court to **stop proceedings** in a case that is beyond the jurisdiction of the lower court. It is issued while the proceedings are still going on.\n*   **Writ of Certiorari:** This is an order issued by a superior court to a judicial authority, typically after an order has already been passed. The superior court desires \"to be informed of what is going on\" and can quash the lower court's order.\n*   The **Writ of Certiorari** is issued after the order has already been passed by the lower court.\n\n(c) The three distinct types of limitations that can be imposed on Fundamental Rights are:\n1.  **Suspension during Emergency:** The Fundamental Rights, particularly those under Article 19, can be suspended when the President declares a state of Emergency in the country under Article 352 (in cases of war, external aggression, or armed rebellion). This suspension is temporary and lasts only for the duration of the Emergency.\n2.  **Reasonable Restrictions for National Interest:** The State can impose 'reasonable restrictions' on the enjoyment of Fundamental Rights in the interest of the security of the State, public order, and national interest. The Constitution empowers the State to make valid exceptions to the rights on these grounds.\n3.  **Specific Restrictive Legislations:** Parliament can enact specific laws that curtail certain freedoms for the public good or to maintain order. Examples from the text include the Preventive Detention Act (PDA), the National Security Act 1980 (NSA), and the Essential Services Maintenance Act (ESMA), which restricts rights to ensure the delivery of essential services to the public.",

The government denies the request citing 'national security'. The journalist then publishes a speculative article alleging corruption, leading to public unrest. Citing the need to maintain public order and national security, the government arrests the journalist under the National Security Act (NSA), a form of Preventive Detention. Analyse this scenario based on the provided text by answering the following:\n(a) Identify the journalist's initial right and explain its constitutional status as described in the text.\n(b) Evaluate the government's decision to deny the information request, referencing the principles of limitations on Fundamental Rights.\n(c) Justify the government's power to arrest the journalist under the NSA, linking it to the constitutional provisions on restrictions.\n(d) If the journalist is detained for four months without trial, what constitutional procedure must have been followed? Which writ could her lawyer file to challenge the legality of her detention?",
          "model_answer_text": "(a) The journalist's initial right is the Right to Information (RTI). According to the text, it is an implied Fundamental Right included in Article 19(1). It is considered implicit in the Right to Freedom of Speech and Expression (Article 19) because one cannot speak freely without knowing the facts.\n\n(b) The government's decision is constitutionally justifiable. The text states that Fundamental Rights are not absolute and 'reasonable restrictions' can be imposed for the 'security of the State' and 'national interest', which are considered of paramount interest. A defence contract could fall under this exception.\n\n(c) The government's power to arrest under the National Security Act (NSA) is justified as a constitutional restriction on the Right to Freedom. The text explicitly names the NSA as a law made to safeguard the interests of the nation, which can curtail the use of Fundamental Rights. It is a form of Preventive Detention, which is mentioned as a limitation.\n\n(d) For detention beyond three months under Preventive Detention, the case must be referred to an Advisory Board consisting of a judge of the High Court, which must approve the extension. The lawyer could file the writ of Habeas Corpus, which means 'to have the body', to challenge the unlawful detention and secure the journalist's release.",

          "question_text": "A state government passes a law that all admissions to its state-funded engineering colleges will require applicants to prove proficiency in the state's regional language, effectively denying admission to students from other states. Further, the state assembly abolishes a 'Khan Bahadur' title awarded by the British but simultaneously creates a new state honour titled 'Rajya Bhushan' for 'eminent residents of the state'. A student denied admission challenges the law. Analyse the constitutional validity of the state's actions with reference to the provided text:\n(a) On what grounds related to citizenship and fundamental equality could the language proficiency rule be challenged? Refer to the relevant articles.\n(b) The state argues that this law is protected under Article 29, which allows a section of people to preserve their distinct language and culture. Is this a valid argument in the context of admission to a state-maintained institution? Explain.\n(c) Analyse the constitutional validity of the state creating the 'Rajya Bhushan' title, referencing the principles laid out in Article 18.\n(d) If a court finds the admission law to be inconsistent with Fundamental Rights, what is the consequence for that law according to Article 13(2)? Which writ could be issued by a superior court to the college administration to compel them to perform their duty of admitting a qualified student?",
          "model_answer_text": "(a) The rule could be challenged on two primary grounds. First, it violates the principle of Single Citizenship, which ensures that all Indians are citizens of India, irrespective of their state of domicile, and aims to ward off separatist tendencies. Second, it violates Article 15, which prohibits discrimination in admission to educational institutions on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth (implied from 'State of domicile'). It also infringes upon the broader guarantee of Equality before Law under Article-14.\n\n(b) This is not a valid argument. While Article 29 protects the right to preserve a distinct language, script, and culture, the text also explicitly states under the same article heading that 'In the matter of admission to any educational institution maintained by the State, admission cannot be denied on grounds of religion, colour, caste, creed or sex.' The state's action directly contradicts this provision against discrimination in admission to state-maintained institutions.\n\n(c) The abolition of 'Khan Bahadur' is in line with Article 18, which abolishes titles that negate equal status. However, the creation of 'Rajya Bhushan' is permissible. Article 18 allows for titles like 'Bharat Ratna' given for meritorious public service. The new title, if awarded for genuine merit and not as a hereditary or aristocratic honour, does not fall under the prohibition of Article 18.\n\n(d) According to Article 13(2), if a law is found to be inconsistent with fundamental rights, it is declared void to the extent of such inconsistency. A superior court could issue the writ of Mandamus, which means 'we order'. This writ is a command to an administrative authority (like the college) to perform a certain duty it has failed to perform.",

          "question_text": "During a period of heightened cross-border tensions, the President of India declares a National Emergency under Article 352, citing threats to the security of the State. Subsequently, the editor of a national newspaper is arrested under the National Security Act (NSA) for publishing an editorial that sharply criticises the government's defence policy, and is detained without trial. The editor's legal team attempts to file a Habeas Corpus writ petition in the Supreme Court, but is informed that the President has issued an Order suspending the right to move any court for the enforcement of Fundamental Rights. \n\nAnalyse this scenario based on the provided text. Explain the constitutional provisions that permit the State's actions, identifying the specific right of the editor that is affected and the legal mechanisms that are suspended.",
          "model_answer_text": "1.  **Affected Fundamental Right**: The editor's affected right is the 'Freedom of speech and expression' guaranteed under Article 19 of the Constitution. The text clarifies that 'freedom of the Press' is included within this wider freedom of 'expression'.\n\n2.  **Justification for State Action**: The State's actions are permissible under the provisions for the suspension of Fundamental Rights during an Emergency. The text states that when a proclamation of Emergency is made by the President under Article 352, Fundamental Rights can be suspended. Specifically, Article 19 can be suspended, and the Legislature is free to make any law and the Executive can take any action that restricts this right. Laws like the National Security Act (NSA) are mentioned as instruments that curtail Fundamental Rights to safeguard national interests.\n\n3.  **Suspension of Constitutional Remedies**: The editor's inability to approach the Supreme Court is due to the President's power during an Emergency to issue an Order declaring that the right to move a court for the enforcement of Fundamental Rights shall remain suspended. The text explicitly mentions that in such a situation, the Supreme Court and High Courts become powerless to issue writs, including the writ of Habeas Corpus, which is meant to safeguard personal freedom against unlawful detention. The suspension of these remedies makes the Executive's actions legally unchallengeable for the duration of the Emergency.",

A wealthy industrialist from another state challenges this law, arguing that it infringes upon his constitutional rights. He claims that as a citizen of India, he has the right to settle anywhere in the country and that this law discriminates against him based on his place of domicile. \n\nAs a constitutional scholar, evaluate the industrialist's claims against the provisions of the Constitution mentioned in the text. Deduce whether the state's law is likely to be upheld, providing specific constitutional justifications for your conclusion.",
          "model_answer_text": "1.  **Industrialist's Claims and Rights**: The industrialist's claims are based on two Fundamental Rights. Firstly, the 'Freedom to reside and settle in any part of India', guaranteed under Article 19. Secondly, he implicitly invokes the principle of Single Citizenship, which means all Indians are citizens of India, irrespective of their State of domicile, and should not be discriminated against on this basis (related to the spirit of Article 15).\n\n2.  **Constitutional Justification for the State Law**: Despite the industrialist's claims, the state's law is likely to be upheld. The text specifies that Fundamental Rights are not absolute and are subject to reasonable restrictions. Crucially, regarding the 'Freedom to reside and settle in any part of India' (Article 19), the text explicitly states a limitation: this right \"cannot go against the laws of a particular territory where larger national interest is involved. For example, one cannot displace Tribal communities and settle in their territory.\"\n\n3.  **Conclusion**: The state law directly aligns with this specific limitation mentioned in the text. By restricting land purchase and settlement to protect tribal communities, the state is acting within the constitutional framework of permissible restrictions on a Fundamental Right. The objective is to prevent the displacement of tribal communities and preserve their distinct culture (linking to the spirit of Article 29), which the Constitution considers a 'larger national interest'. Therefore, the industrialist's general right to settle is legitimately curtailed by a specific, constitutionally sanctioned exception.",
