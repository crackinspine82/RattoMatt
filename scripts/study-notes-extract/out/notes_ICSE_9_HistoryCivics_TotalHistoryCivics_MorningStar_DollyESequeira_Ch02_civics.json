        "content_md": "On August 24, 2017, the Supreme Court of India declared the Right to Privacy as a fundamental right.\n\n**(a) Right to Privacy - A Fundamental Right**\nThe Supreme Court confirmed that the right to privacy is a fundamental right that does not need to be separately articulated but can be derived from Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution. It is a fundamental right about all information of a person and the choice that he/she makes. It protects an individual from the scrutiny of the State in their home, of their movements and over their reproductive choice, choice of partners, food habits, etc.\n\n**(b) Not an Absolute Right - It is Subjected to Reasonable Restrictions**\nThe Supreme Court clarified that the fundamental right to privacy is not absolute and will always be subject to reasonable restrictions. The State can impose restrictions on it to protect legitimate State interests but it can only do so by following the points given below:\n1. Existence of a law that justifies an encroachment on privacy;\n2. A legitimate State need that ensures that the nature of this law falls within the zone of reasonableness and without arbitrary State action; and\n3. The means adopted by the State are proportional to the objects and needs sought to be fulfilled by the law.\n\nAccording to the judgement, the legitimate aims of the state should be “protecting national security, preventing and investigating crime, encouraging innovation and the spread of knowledge, and preventing the dissipation of social welfare benefits.”\n\n**What Privacy includes**\n1. Preservation of personal intimacies, the sanctity of family life, marriage, procreation, home and sexual orientation.\n2. A right to be left alone.\n3. Safeguards individual autonomy, protecting vital aspects of his/her life.\n4. Personal choices governing a way of life are intrinsic to privacy.\n5. It recognises plurality and diversity of our culture."

This amendment made the Right to Property (Article 300A) a Legal right."

It is a fundamental right about all information of a person and the choice that he/she makes. It protects an individual from the scrutiny of the State in their home, of their movements and over their reproductive choice, choice of partners, food habits, etc.\n\n**(b) Not an Absolute Right - It is Subjected to Reasonable Restrictions**\nThe Supreme Court clarified that the fundamental right to privacy is not absolute and will always be subject to reasonable restrictions. The State can impose restrictions on it to protect legitimate State interests but it can only do so by following the points given below:\n1. Existence of a law that justifies an encroachment on privacy;\n2. A legitimate State need that ensures that the nature of this law falls within the zone of reasonableness and without arbitrary State action; and\n3. The means adopted by the State are proportional to the objects and needs sought to be fulfilled by the law.\n\nAccording to the judgement, the legitimate aims of the state should be “protecting national security, preventing and investigating crime, encouraging innovation and the spread of knowledge, and preventing the dissipation of social welfare benefits.”\n\n**What Privacy includes**\n1. Preservation of personal intimacies, the sanctity of family life, marriage, procreation, home and sexual orientation.\n2. A right to be left alone.\n3. Safeguards individual autonomy, protecting vital aspects of his/her life.\n4. Personal choices governing a way of life are intrinsic to privacy.\n5.
