      "content_md": "The **Mauryan empire** was founded in the **4th century BC by Chandragupta Maurya**. He organised a powerful army and laid the foundation of a vast empire. He overthrew the **Nandas** from Magadha and the **Greek Satraps** from the North-West Frontier and unified a large part of the Indian subcontinent under his centralised government. His successor **Bindusara** kept the Mauryan Empire intact and further extended its boundaries.\n\nThe reign of Bindusara's son, **Ashoka** constitutes one of the brightest periods in the Indian history. After the **Kalinga War**, Ashoka devoted his life to human welfare. He considered his subjects as his children. He built many marvels in art and architecture, some of which have survived up to this day.\n\n[Image: Chanakya]"

He was the advisor and Prime Minister of Chandragupta. **Arthashastra** is written in Sanskrit. It is a comprehensive manual that deals with politics, rules of diplomacy, principles of administration and other such political topics. This book was discovered in 1909 and its English translation is now available."

He wrote a book named **Indika** which contains his impressions of what he heard and saw during his stay in India. Megasthenes' original Indika has been lost, but its fragments still survive in the writings of later Greek authors like Strabo, Arrian and Diodorus. Megasthenes wrote the following account about what he saw in India.\n\n\"The occasions on which the emperor appears in public are celebrated with grand royal processions. He is carried in a golden palanquin. His guards ride elephants decorated with gold and silver. Some of the guards carry trees on which live birds, including a flock of trained parrots, circle about the head of the emperor. The king is normally surrounded by armed women. He is afraid that someone may try to kill him. He has special servants to taste the food before he eats. He never sleeps in the same bedroom for two nights\"."

      "content_md": "An **edict** is a decree issued by a Sovereign. The edicts of Ashoka form the most important source of Mauryan history. They are the oldest, best preserved and precisely dated records of India. These edicts are inscribed on rocks and pillars throughout the country and include **14 Major Rock edicts**, **Seven Pillar edicts** and a number of **Minor Rock edicts**. The inscriptions on these edicts provide a useful insight into the life and ideals of Ashoka in particular and about the history of the Mauryas in general.\n\nExcept those at Shahbazgarhi and Mansehra, which are inscribed in the **Kharosthi script** running, like Arabic, from right to left, the rest are all engraved in the **Brahmi lipi**, written from left to right.\n\nThe most important event of Ashoka's reign was the conquest of Kalinga. The indescribable sufferings and atrocities of the Kalinga war deeply touched Ashoka's conscience and he made a solemn resolve not to take up arms any more. The war drum (**bherighosha**) was silenced forever, and henceforth were heard only the echoes of '**Dhammaghosha**', the call to non-violence and universal peace.\n\n[Image: Ashokan Edict]\n\nIn pursuance of his policy of **non-violence**, Ashoka prohibited killing of animals for sacrifices; advocated restraint in the number that had to be killed for consumption; protected some of the animals, and in general condemned cruel acts against animals. Reference to protection of animals is made in the **Rock Edict-I** which states,\n\n\"Formerly, in the great refectory and temple of the heaven-beloved king **Piyadasi**, daily were many hundred thousand animals sacrificed for the sake of meat food. So even at this day while this religious edict is under promulgation, from the sacrifice of animals for the sake of food, some two are killed, or one is killed; but now the joyful chorus resounds again and again that henceforward not a single animal shall be put do death.\" (As translated by James Princep)."

      "content_md": "A **stupa** is a semi-spherical solid dome-like structure made of unburnt bricks and stones. The Buddhist stupa has special significance. It represents the spiritual body of Buddha containing his relics such as hair, teeth or bones. A casket containing these relics is placed at the base of the dome. The foundation of the **Sanchi Stupa** was laid by Ashoka at Sanchi about 45 km from Bhopal in Madhya Pradesh. There are four gateways in four directions. They have carved panels depicting events from the life of Buddha and some tales from Jataka stories. Buddha is represented by symbols like the peepal tree, lotus, or a wheel. The pillars are surmounted by capitals which contain sculptures of lions. The most important of these capitals is the **Lion Capital**, a sculpture showing four Asiatic lions standing back to back, on an elaborate base that includes other animals. It was officially adopted as the **Emblem of India**, in 1950.\n\n[Image: Sanchi Stupa]"

      "content_md": "**Chandragupta Maurya** was the founder of the Mauryan Empire. Not much is known about his childhood. According to a legend he had been dismissed from the service of Nandas who ruled before him. He met Kautilya at Takshila. Kautilya, who later became famous as **Chanakya**, was the son of a Brahmin. Kautilya too was wronged by the Nandas. He, therefore, joined hands with Chandragupta to destroy the Nanda dynasty.\n\nAfter a long series of battles with Chandragupta, the Nanda capital at Pataliputra fell. This led to the emergence of a new dynasty — the Mauryan dynasty with Chandragupta Maurya as the emperor.\n\nAlexander, the Greek ruler had conquered many states in the North-Western part of India. After his death his territories in the Indian subcontinent were taken over by Chandragupta Maurya. With the help of Chanakya he embarked on the consolidation process of his empire.\n\nIn **305 BC**, India was again attacked by **Seleucus**, a former general under Alexander. Chandragupta defeated Seleucus. According to the treaty signed with Seleucus, Chandragupta got **Kabul, Kandahar, Herat and Baluchistan** from the Greek commander. Seleucus gave his daughter **Helen**, in marriage to Chandragupta. After this victory Chandragupta appointed **Pushyagupta** as the governor of his North-Western province. He then proceeded to the south and captured some territories there.\n\nChandragupta's empire extended from Kabul and Kandahar in the North-West to Mysore in the south; and from Bengal in the east to Saurashtra in the west.\n\nAccording to the Jain tradition, after ruling for 24 years, he renounced the world. He handed over the kingdom to his son, **Bindusara**.\n\n[Image: Lion Capital]\n[Image: Ashoka's visit to a Stupa (from Sanchi Stupa)]"

He abandoned the policy of **'conquest by force' (bherigosha)** and ambition of **'victory in all directions' (Digvijay)** and embraced the policy of **religion (Dhammagosha)**.\n(ii) Kalinga changed Ashoka's personal life. He stopped hunting and eating meat and abandoned the life of luxury.\n(iii) The prisoners of war were used for agricultural work. It resulted in an increase in production and brought about economic prosperity in his empire.\n(iv) Ashoka himself went on tours to preach Buddhism to people. He also sent missionaries to the various parts of the world. He sent his daughter, **Sanghamitra** and son, **Mahindra** to Sri Lanka to propagate Buddhism.\n(v) Ashoka, after the Kalinga War, embraced Buddhism and followed the Buddhist principles in his State Policy like non-violence and disapproval of empty rituals.\n(vi) He got erected several pillars and edicts to spread the teachings of Buddhism. He ordered the construction of **84,000 Stupas** to keep the relics of Buddha. He gave donations to Buddhist viharas.\n(vii) On account of abandonment of war there was a decline in military preparedness and efficiency."

      "content_md": "The Mauryan empire beginning with Chandragupta Maurya was vast, with an all-India character.\n\nSeleucus, whom Chandragupta defeated in war, had handed him four provinces of Kabul, Kandahar, Herat and Baluchistan. These remained with the Mauryan empire right up to the end of Ashoka's rule. During Bindusara's rule, Ashoka reached Takshila and quelled the revolt there. After Bindusara had established his rule over South India no other king ever ruled over the whole of India. The fact that Chandragupta Maurya spent his last years at Shravanabelagola in Karnataka speaks volumes about the all India character of the Mauryan empire.\n\n**The chief advantages of the Pan-Indian character of his empire were the following:**\n(a) It marked the end of small states.\n(b) It helped in establishing trade links with foreign countries.\n(c) It made India strong and helped the Mauryan kings face foreign aggressions successfully.\n(d) After Ashoka's victory over Kalinga, the era of conquests and wars was over. It helped the Mauryan kings to pay more attention to social and economic life of the people. Hence, there was an all-round economic prosperity."

      "title": "Administration",
      "level_label": "Topic",
      "content_md": "It was Chandragupta Maurya, under the guidance of Chanakya, who laid the foundations of an elaborate system of administration. Chanakya wrote a book **‘Arthashastra’** in which he describes the principles of politics and the art of administration. Chandragupta's son Bindusara retained the same system and Ashoka made some changes necessitated by the change of heart after the Kalinga War.\n\n(i) Ashoka added a new fifth province, **Kalinga** in the existing four provinces, with **Tosali** as its capital.\n(ii) The Mauryan centralised monarchy became a **paternal despotism** under Ashoka. In one of his Edicts, Ashoka says, **'all men are my children'**.\n(iii) Ashoka simplified many rigorous practices related to administration regarding taxation and crop collection. This helped to increase productivity and economic activity across the Empire.\n(iv) Ashoka appointed **Mahamatras (Governors)** to look after the welfare of his subjects.\n\nMauryan administration had two main divisions—**Civil Administration** and **Military Administration**.\n\n**Civil Administration:** The Civil administration had two main divisions—the **Central Government** and the **Provincial Government**.\n\n**(i) Central Government:** The Mauryan government was centralised and was managed by several officers of different ranks. The king was the supreme authority and his throne was hereditary. He was also the supreme judge. Megasthenes, in his book **Indica** and Chanakya in the **Arthashastra**, tell us about the Mauryan administration. Ashoka appointed **Mahamatras** (governors) to look after the welfare of his subjects. At the central level, the king was assisted by the council of ministers (**Mantri Parishad**) headed by the Prime Minister. Each minister was responsible for his department. The council of ministers included:\n*   **Purohit:** The chief Pujari of the state.\n*   **Senapati:** Advised the king on matters related to war and peace.\n*   **Sannidhata:** The head treasurer.\n*   **Samaharta:** The taxation expert.\n*   Other important officers: Accountant General, one incharge of agriculture, Superintendent of mines, Superintendent of Ports, Controller of Commerce, and the Superintendent of Weights and Measures.\n\n**(ii) Provincial Government:** Ashoka made alterations only in the central government. During his grandfather's time there were four provinces and after the addition of Kalinga in Ashoka's time, there were five provinces:\n| Province | Capital |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| 1. Magadha | Pataliputra |\n| 2. Gandhara (North-western Province) | Takshila |\n| 3. Avanti (Eastern Province) | Ujjain |\n| 4. Southern Province | Swarnagiri |\n| 5. Kalinga | Tosali |\n\nHead of the province was called **Kumar** or **Aryaputra**. Only the princes were appointed to this position. During Ashoka's time the Kumar was assisted by the Governor (**Mahamatra**). Other officers included **Pradeshika** (collected taxes), **Rajuka** (performed functions of modern day Tehsildar or revenue officer), and **Yukta** (the treasurer).\n\n**(iii) District Administration:** The provinces were divided into districts called **Janapadas**. Their administration was looked after by **Pradeshika, Rajuka and Yukta**.\n\n**(iv) Administration of Cities:** Important cities, the capitals of provinces, had their own administrative system. The head of the city was called **Nagaradhyaksha**. According to Megasthenes, the administration of Pataliputra was looked after by a committee of 30 members.\n\n**(v) The Revenue System:** The land revenue was the chief source of income, ranging from one-sixth to one-fourth of the produce. Two kinds of taxes, **Bali** and **Bhaga**, are mentioned in the Edicts of Ashoka. **Bhaga** was levied on agricultural produce and cattle at one-sixth. **Bali** was a religious tribute. **Toll tax** was imposed on articles brought for sale. Taxes were also levied on liquor shops, gambling houses, forests and mines. The revenue funded facilities like roads, irrigation, and hospitals.\n\n**(vi) The Spy System:** Chandragupta Maurya had a wide network of spies. There were spies against spies and multiple agents were used for important matters. The king was always kept informed of the working of the bureaucracy.\n\n**(vii) Military Administration:** Chandragupta Maurya maintained a huge army. According to Megasthenes, it consisted of 6,00,000 infantry, 30,000 cavalry, and 9000 war-elephants. Another source mentions 8000 chariots. Chief weapons were bows, arrows, shields, swords, etc. The king was the commander-in-chief. The army was under a military commission of thirty members. Soldiers were paid salary in cash. The king had built forts at strategic places for safety.\n\n**THINK ABOUT IT: Early Postal System**\nAn early postal system existed during the reign of Emperor Chandragupta Maurya. He used the pigeon post for communication between the capital city and provincial capitals, a system that continued under Emperor Ashoka. Letters in little cachets were tied to the feet of trained pigeons which flew to specific destinations."
