      "title": "CAUSES OF RENAISSANCE",
      "level_label": "Section",
      "content_md": "The term **Renaissance** means rebirth or revival. It stands for a complex transitional movement in Europe between medieval and modern times beginning in the 14th century in Italy and lasting into the 17th century. It marked the revival of the freedom to think and act without being controlled by any external agency. It was also a revival of the study of the ancient Greek and Roman classics. One of the remarkable changes was the disintegration of the feudal system in Europe which ushered in a new social and economic order, marking the beginning of the modern era."

      "level_label": "Topic",
      "content_md": "**Constantinople** was the capital of the Eastern Roman Empire and a centre of Greek and Roman cultures, holding valuable manuscripts of Greek and Roman writers. When Constantinople fell into the hands of the **Turks in 1453**, many Greek and Roman scholars were forced to shift to Rome and other parts of Europe with their manuscripts. Rome then became the centre of Greek culture. These scholars, who were men of liberal outlook, humanism and logical thinking, spread their new spirit and ideas wherever they went. They revived the interest of the people in the study of Greek philosophy, science, art and literature. The revival of the learning of Greek classics paved the way for the Renaissance."

      "title": "DECLINE OF FEUDALISM",
      "level_label": "Topic",
      "content_md": "**Feudalism** was a system where medieval European society was organised on the basis of land tenure. People, from the King down to the lowest landowners, were bound together by obligation and defence.\n\n*   The **King** gave estates to his lords, known as **Dukes** and **Earls**.\n*   The **Lords** distributed land to lesser lords or **Barons**, who provided military support.\n*   Dukes and Earls owed allegiance to the King, while Barons owed allegiance to the Dukes and Earls.\n*   **Knights** formed the lower category of feudal lords.\n*   The feudal lords gave land to peasants for cultivation.\n\n[Image: Feudal Structure]\n\nThe society had a graded organisation with little chance for social mobility and progress, and it was opposed to freedom and equality of rights. The **decline of feudalism in the 13th and 14th centuries** provided an impetus to free thinking. The resulting peace and freedom favoured the growth of New Learning, leading to new developments in art, literature, philosophy, and science, which contributed to the rise of the Renaissance."

      "level_label": "Topic",
      "content_md": "[Image: Christopher Columbus]\n[Image: Ferdinand Magellan]\n\nThe navigators of Portugal and Spain were important in geographical explorations and discovering new trade routes. After the fall of Constantinople to the Turks in 1453, the trade routes between the West and the East were closed. This created a need for European traders and navigators to discover new sea routes.\n\n*   **Prince Henry**, the Navigator of Portugal, discovered a sea route to Africa.\n*   **Bartholomew Diaz** reached the Cape of Good Hope at the southernmost point of Africa.\n*   **Columbus** discovered America in 1492.\n*   In 1498, **Vasco da Gama** sailed to India.\n*   **Ferdinand Magellan** made a voyage around the world, reaching a vast ocean he called the Pacific Ocean.\n\nThese discoveries developed contact and a fusion of ideas between the East and West. The new trade routes encouraged trade, created a spirit of adventure, and broadened the mental horizon."

      "content_md": "In the Medieval Age, human activities were controlled by the authority of the Pope and the Church, and independent thinking was not allowed. However, many scholars discarded medieval ideas and developed a **spirit of enquiry** and curiosity. They taught people to ask the 'Why' and 'How' of things, questioning the authority of the Church and seeking a transition from faith to reason, observation, and experimentation."

      "level_label": "Subtopic",
      "content_md": "During the Medieval Age, the Church discouraged original thinking, demanding faith in its dogmas. However, bold and independent thinkers criticised the Church and encouraged people to develop their own thinking. Thinkers like **Roger Bacon**, **Abelard**, and **Thomas Aquinas** revolutionised the thought process, laying stress on reasoning. These original thinkers are known as the **forerunners of Renaissance**."

They brought the people of Europe into direct contact with the people of Asia, introducing ideas from the East to Western Europe. This widened their outlook on life, and people began to rely on reason rather than on blind faith."

      "content_md": "In the age of faith, science had little scope. However, some medieval scholars showed a scientific attitude and encouraged students to observe nature, leading to new inventions and discoveries. The development of science created a spirit of enquiry and scientific temper.\n\n*   **Roger Bacon** contemplated the use of horseless carriages and flying machines.\n*   **Copernicus** proved that the earth moves round the sun.\n*   **Galileo** invented the telescope.\n\nThese inventions broadened the mental outlook of the people and ended old beliefs and traditions."

      "content_md": "[Image: Printing Press]\n\nThe first printing press was set up in Germany by **Gutenberg** in the middle of the 15th century. Later, **Caxton** introduced it in England.\n\nThe invention made it possible to produce books in large numbers. The Bible and other religious and classical books were printed and made available across Europe. The printing press spread knowledge widely, as scholars found printed books easier to read than hand-written manuscripts. In the Middle Ages, books were few and beyond the reach of ordinary people. The Printing Press enabled the multiplication and distribution of books, influencing people's attitudes to life and bringing about a new awakening in Europe."

The word 'humanism' is derived from the Latin words '**Studia humanitatis**' or 'the studies of mankind'. It represented a decisive shift in concern for humans as distinct from divine matters. **Humanism** extolled man and stressed his essential dignity. It was centred on man's earthly joys and sorrows, opposing religious asceticism. It defended man's right to pleasure and the satisfaction of earthly desires. Humanists looked to ancient classics from thinkers like **Plato, Virgil, Aristotle, Cicero, and Quintilianus** for ideas.\n\n*Note: In this Chapter, following traditional conventions, man is used to refer to humankind as an entity.*"

Their work was permeated with the belief that a man with an active mind and body could know and control the world, perform miracles, and shape his own happiness.

      "level_label": "Section",
      "content_md": "The Renaissance first began in Italy and spread from there to other parts of the world for the following reasons:\n\n1.  **Italy was the seat of the glorious Roman Empire**, and all its historical remains and relics attracted numerous scholars and artists.\n2.  Following the **Fall of Constantinople**, a large number of Greek scholars and thinkers migrated to Italy with their original manuscripts and art treasures. They instilled a spirit of enquiry and encouraged Italian artists and writers to produce masterpieces.\n3.  The **enormous wealth** Italy accumulated from trade with the East contributed to the rise of Renaissance. The wealthy merchants of Italy patronised artists and literary figures, using their wealth to revive classical culture and literature.\n4.  As a result of the **crusades and geographical explorations**, Italians came into contact with the East, which greatly broadened their vision and provided an impetus to Renaissance."

Renaissance artists refused to follow medieval rules and traditions. They adopted new artistic methods like **frescoes** for wall pictures, **oil colours**, and **woodcuts**. They studied optics and geometry to develop perspective in their paintings and also studied human anatomy to understand the mechanics of gestures and expressions."

His famous paintings, **'The Virgin of the Rocks'**, **'The Last Supper'**, and **'Mona Lisa'**, are masterpieces that used new techniques to create a fine feeling of reality.\n    [Image: Leonardo Da Vinci]\n    [Image: Mona Lisa]\n    [Image: The Last Supper by Leonardo da Vinci]\n*   **Michelangelo:** A painter, sculptor, architect, and poet who concentrated on painting the human figure.
