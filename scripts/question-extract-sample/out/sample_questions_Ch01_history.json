Recent research indicates that its roots lie deep in Indian soil. Historians have found marked similarities between pre-Harappan and proto-Harappan cultures at sites like Kot Diji, Amri, and Kalibangan and the mature Harappan Civilisation, particularly in features like granaries, defensive walls, and long-distance trade. This suggests an evolution from these local agricultural communities.\n\nThe 'Foreign Origin' theory is largely rejected for the following reasons:\n1. Excavations at various Harappan sites have revealed striking differences between the Harappan and Mesopotamian Civilisations, which contradicts the idea that the former was simply an offshoot of the latter.\n2. The view that trade with Mesopotamia was the primary stimulus for its development has been rejected because there is no evidence of trade with Mesopotamia during the early Harappan period.",

Wood was essential for producing bronze (smelting copper with tin/zinc), baking bricks and pottery, and making boats and furniture. This high demand for wood could have led to widespread deforestation. Deforestation, in turn, may have resulted in climatic changes in the region, such as increased aridity, leading to the gradual decline of the civilisation.\n\nThe theory of decline proposed by Mortimer Wheeler is that the Aryans attacked and destroyed the Indus settlements. The evidence he cited to support this theory was the discovery of skeletons of 13 men and women, and one child, found lying massacred in the streets and houses in the last phase of Mohenjo-daro.",

This discovery placed the Harappan Civilisation at par with other great Bronze Age civilisations like Mesopotamia and Egypt.\n\nIt is also known as the Indus Valley Civilisation for the following two reasons:\n1. Some of its important sites, which were excavated first, are located in the valley of the river Indus.\n2. The two most important cities, Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, are linked by the river Indus.",

Archaeologists found remains of stone anchors, marine shells, and seals which can be traced to the Persian Gulf.\n\n(c) Internal trade refers to the trade in goods like stone, metal, shell, etc., within the Indus civilisation zone. An example is the import of rice to Punjab from Gujarat. \nExternal trade refers to commercial contacts with western neighbours like Mesopotamia and West Asian sites. An example is the import of gold from Afghanistan or copper from Arabia.\n\n(d) The discovery is important for two reasons:\n1. It pushed back the history of India by at least a thousand years, as it was previously believed that Indian history began with the advent of the Aryans.\n2.

          "model_answer_text": "(a) Two significant artefacts discovered at Mohenjo-daro are:\n1. The stone sculpture of a bearded man (often called the Priest-King).\n2. The bronze statue of the dancing girl.\n\n(b) The study of the Great Bath allows us to infer the following about the Harappan Civilisation:\n1. The art of building had reached a high degree of perfection, as seen in the watertight construction using burnt bricks, mortar, bitumen, and gypsum.\n2. The existence of a strong ruling class is indicated, as such a massive public structure would require mobilization of labour, collection of taxes, and organised planning.\n3. The structure was likely used for religious purposes, suggesting the importance of ceremonial and ritual bathing in their culture.\n\n(c) The significance of Harappan seals is as follows:\n(i) Commercial Life: The seals were used by traders for commercial purposes. They were pressed onto wet clay on the knots of goods to create an impression. An intact seal at the destination indicated that the goods had not been tampered with. It also conveyed the identity of the sender. The discovery of these seals in Mesopotamian sites confirms long-distance overseas trade.\n(ii) Religious Beliefs: The seals provide insight into Harappan religious beliefs. The Pashupati seal, depicting a three-faced deity seated in a yogic posture and surrounded by animals, is identified as a prototype of Lord Shiva (Pashupati Mahadeva). The depiction of a unicorn on some seals points towards their mythical beliefs. Seals may also have been used as amulets for protection.",

In this context, answer the following:\n(a) State two reasons why the theory of the Harappan Civilisation having a 'foreign origin' is largely rejected. [2]\n(b) Mention three distinctive features of Harappan urban planning. [3]\n(c) Explain in detail any two distinct theories that account for the decline of the Harappan Civilisation. [5]",
          "model_answer_text": "(a) The theory of a 'foreign origin', particularly that the Harappan Civilisation was an offshoot of Mesopotamia, is rejected for two main reasons:\n1. There are striking differences between Harappan and Mesopotamian civilisations, such as in town planning (grid pattern vs. circular), script, and seals.\n2. There is no evidence of trade with Mesopotamia during the early Harappan period, which would have been a prerequisite for such a significant cultural influence or migration.\n\n(b) Three distinctive features of Harappan urban planning were:\n1. Division of the city: Each city was divided into a raised 'Citadel' which housed important public buildings and the ruling class, and a 'lower town' with residential buildings for the general populace.\n2. Grid Pattern: The main streets followed a grid pattern, running from north to south and east to west, crossing each other at right angles and dividing the city into rectangular blocks.\n3. Advanced Drainage System: The cities had a sophisticated network of covered drains. House drains emptied waste water into street drains, which were brick-lined, showcasing a high regard for sanitation and public health.\n\n(c) Two theories explaining the decline of the Harappan Civilisation are:\n1. Floods and Earthquakes: This theory suggests that recurrent flooding, evidenced by layers of silty clay found at Mohenjo-daro, gradually weakened the civilisation. Some scholars, like R.L. Raikes, have argued that these were not normal floods. They proposed that tectonic activities, such as earthquakes, may have raised the level of the Indus flood plains, blocking the river's path to the sea. This would have caused the river's water to rise and submerge vast areas, including cities like Mohenjo-daro, leading to their abandonment.\n2. Increased Aridity and Shift in River Courses: This theory, proposed by historians like D.P. Agarwal and Sood, posits that climate change led to increasing aridity in the region. A key factor was the drying up of the Ghaggar-Hakra river system. It is believed that due to tectonic disturbances, its main tributaries, the Sutlej and Yamuna, changed their course. The Sutlej was captured by the Indus and the Yamuna shifted east to join the Ganges. This ecological disturbance, caused by the loss of a major river system, would have made agriculture unsustainable, leading to the gradual decline and abandonment of the settlements.",

          "question_text": "With reference to the sources of the Harappan Civilisation, answer the following questions:\n\n(a) The Harappan Civilisation is considered a Bronze Age Civilisation. State why it is called a ‘Bronze Age’ civilisation and name any two other contemporary Bronze Age civilisations. [3]\n\n(b) Describe three key architectural features of the Great Bath at Mohenjo-daro. What does its massive structure and construction imply about the Harappan society and government? [3]\n\n(c) The Harappan seals and the Dockyard at Lothal are significant sources of information. Explain what the discovery of Harappan seals in different regions and the features of the Lothal dockyard reveal about the nature and extent of Harappan trade. [4]",
          "model_answer_text": "(a) The Harappan Civilisation is called a ‘Bronze Age’ civilisation because its people had learned the art of mixing copper with tin or zinc to produce the alloy called Bronze. Bronze was harder and more suitable for making tools and weapons, and its importance in the growth of the civilisation gives the period its name.\nTwo other contemporary Bronze Age civilisations were the Mesopotamian Civilisation and the Egyptian Civilisation. (Also acceptable: Chinese Civilisation).\n\n(b) Three key architectural features of the Great Bath are:\n1. It was a large rectangular tank in a courtyard surrounded by a corridor.\n2. It had two flights of steps, in the north and south, leading into the tank.\n3. To make it watertight, it was constructed with burnt bricks and mortar lined with bitumen and gypsum.\n\nThe massive structure and meticulous construction imply the existence of a ruling class that could mobilise labour, collect taxes, and build such a huge public structure. It also indicates that the art of building and efficient planning had reached a high degree of perfection.\n\n(c) The Harappan seals and the Lothal dockyard reveal extensive internal and external trade.\n\nSignificance of Seals: The discovery of about 2000 seals, used by traders to stamp their goods, provides crucial information. The impression of a seal on a clay knot on a bag of goods indicated that the goods had not been tampered with and also conveyed the identity of the sender. The discovery of these seals in different regions, including Mesopotamia, indicates that Harappan trade had spread over a vast area and that they had commercial contacts with their western neighbours.\n\nSignificance of the Dockyard at Lothal: The discovery of a rectangular dockyard at Lothal, made of baked bricks and connected by channels to the Gulf of Cambay, strongly suggests it was a port for overseas trade. The presence of stone anchors, marine shells, and seals traceable to the Persian Gulf confirms this. Mesopotamian records refer to trade with 'Meluha' (the Indus region) and the depiction of ships on seals further supports the existence of maritime trade. Together, these sources show that the Harappans had a well-established trade network, both by land and sea, connecting them to Central and West Asia.",

In this context, answer the following:\n\n(a) Name the two most important Harappan cities. State any two common elements in their urban planning that suggest they were developed with a common design. [3]\n\n(b) The Harappan cities followed a grid pattern. Explain this pattern and state two other features of their systematic town planning. [3]\n\n(c) Several theories have been proposed to explain the decline of the Harappan Civilisation. Elaborate on any two of the following causes: \n(i) Floods and Earthquakes\n(ii) Increased Aridity\n(iii) Attack [4]",
          "model_answer_text": "(a) The two most important Harappan cities are Harappa and Mohenjo-daro.\nTwo common elements in their urban planning are:\n1. Both cities had a similar ground plan, including the layout of streets and blocks of houses.\n2. Both cities had highly developed water supply and drainage systems, featuring indoor plumbing, paved bathrooms, and a network of brick-lined sewage channels.\n(Also acceptable: Both measured around 5.0 km in circuit; Both had granaries).\n\n(b) The 'grid pattern' refers to the layout where main streets ran from north to south or from east to west, crossing each other at right angles. This divided the city into square or rectangular blocks.\nTwo other features of their systematic town planning are:\n1. Each city was divided into two parts: a raised area called the 'Citadel' which housed important public buildings, and a 'lower town' with residential buildings.\n2. Houses had covered drains that emptied waste water into the street drains, which were also brick-lined, showing advanced sanitation planning.\n(Also acceptable: Houses at street corners were rounded to allow carts to pass easily).\n\n(c) Elaboration on two theories for the decline:\n\n(i) Floods and Earthquakes: Some scholars believe that repeated floods in Mohenjo-daro led to its decline. Evidence for this is the silty clay found covering houses and streets, indicating submergence. Hydrologist R.L. Raikes suggested this was not normal flooding. He argued that tectonic activity or earthquakes might have raised the level of the Indus flood plains, blocking the river's path to the sea and causing widespread inundation of the city and its hinterland, eventually leading to its abandonment.\n\n(ii) Increased Aridity: Historians D.P. Agarwal and Sood proposed that the civilisation declined due to increasing aridity and the drying up of the river Ghaggar. They suggest that due to tectonic disturbances, the Ghaggar's tributaries, the Sutlej and Yamuna, changed their course. The Sutlej was captured by the Indus and the Yamuna shifted east to join the Ganges. This left the Ghaggar region waterless, causing a massive ecological disturbance that led to the decline of agriculture and subsequently the civilisation.\n\n(iii) Attack: Historian Mortimer Wheeler proposed that the Aryans attacked and destroyed the Indus settlements. His evidence is based on the discovery of skeletons of 13 males, females, and one child found lying in a room in Mohenjo-daro, suggesting they were massacred in the streets and houses during the city's final phase.",

The deity is shown with three faces and has a buffalo-horned head-dress.\n2. The deity is seated cross-legged on a throne (in a yogic posture) and is surrounded by animals like an elephant, a tiger, a buffalo, and a rhinoceros.\n\n(c) Seals provide information about Harappan trade in the following ways:\n1. They were used for commercial purposes. Traders used them to stamp their goods. An impression of the seal on wet clay on the knot of a bag of goods would indicate if it had been tampered with.\n2. The impression also conveyed the identity of the sender or owner. The discovery of these seals in other civilisations like Mesopotamia indicates that the Harappan trade had spread over a vast area.",

A shawl is worn over the left shoulder and under the right arm, in a style similar to that of a priest or ascetic.\n\n**(c)** The high artistic value of the 'Bearded Man' and the 'Dancing Girl' reveals the following about Harappan society and culture:\n1.  **Existence of Skilled Artisans:** The ability to create detailed, three-dimensional figures from materials like stone and bronze indicates the presence of a class of highly skilled craftsmen who had mastered their respective arts.\n2.  **Social Stratification:** The existence of specialised professions like sculptors and metalsmiths suggests a complex urban society with a division of labour, where not everyone was engaged in subsistence farming. This points towards a well-organized social structure.\n3.  **Technological Advancement:** The bronze 'Dancing Girl' particularly showcases a mastery of metallurgy and the complex process of bronze casting. This demonstrates a high degree of technological development and artistic expression in the culture.",

The remains of stone anchors, marine shells, and seals which have been traced to the Persian Gulf.\n2. A structure identified as a warehouse, located near the dock, which would have been used for storing cargo.\n\n**(c)** The significance of the Lothal dockyard is twofold:\n1.  **Economic Prosperity:** It serves as definitive proof of a well-developed overseas trade with contemporary civilisations like Mesopotamia. This external trade, facilitated by such advanced structures, was a cornerstone of Harappan urban economy, indicating immense prosperity and sophisticated knowledge of hydraulic engineering and navigation.\n2.  **Debate on Origins:** The evidence of robust trade provides crucial support for the 'Indigenous Origin' theory. While some scholars argued the Harappan civilisation was an offshoot of Mesopotamia, the indigenous theory posits that local cultures evolved into an urban civilisation. The extensive trade seen at Lothal is interpreted not as a sign of foreign origin, but as an 'external stimulus' that contributed to the growth and flourishing of the natively developed civilisation.",

The features of the statue, such as the detailed carving of the shawl and the meditative expression, indicate that it is of high artistic value. This points to the existence of highly skilled artisans in the Harappan Civilisation who were capable of creating beautiful and realistic three-dimensional figures.\n\n(iii) Another significant sculpture found at Mohenjo-daro is the bronze statue of the 'Dancing Girl'. It is a masterpiece of art showing a female figure with her right arm resting on her hip and her left arm, heavily bangled, holding a small bowl against her left leg. The statue is made of bronze, which is an alloy of copper and tin or zinc. This reveals that the Harappans had advanced metallurgical skills; they knew the art of mixing metals to produce bronze and the technique of casting it to create intricate sculptures.",

It has a large rectangular tank in a courtyard surrounded by a corridor on all four sides. There are two flights of steps, one in the north and the other in the south leading into the tank. To make the pool watertight, burnt bricks and mortar lined with bitumen and gypsum were used for construction. The water for the bath was provided by a well in an adjacent room. Surrounding the bath, were porticos and sets of rooms, and a stairway which led to an upper storey... This structure, with several distinctive features, has led scholars to suggest that it was meant for some kind of a ritual bath. The construction of the Great Bath indicates that the art of building had reached a high degree of perfection at that time. The massive structure points out that there might have existed a ruling class that could mobilise labour, collect taxes and build such a huge structure for the public.'\n\n(i) Where was the Great Bath discovered? [1]\n(ii) State any two materials used to make the tank of the Great Bath watertight. [1]\n(iii) What do most scholars suggest was the purpose of the Great Bath?

Harappan seals provide useful information about the script, trade, religion and beliefs of the Harappans: Seals of Pashupati show that people believed in Shiva... The seals were produced mainly for commercial purpose. The seals were used by traders to stamp their goods.

Of these a great majority comprise short inscriptions with pictures of the one-horned bull, buffalo, tiger, goat, elephant and rhinoceros. Material used in making the seals comprise terracotta, steatite, agate, etc. Most of the seals are rectangular or square but some of them are circular in shape.\nHarappan seals provide useful information about the script, trade, religion and beliefs of the Harappans:\n- Seals of Pashupati show that people believed in Shiva. It is shown as a three-faced deity wearing a buffalo-horned head-dress, seated cross-legged on a throne and surrounded by an elephant, a tiger, a buffalo and a rhinoceros, with two deer at his feet. This deity has been identified as Pashupati Mahadeva.\n- The unicorn seal shows their mythical beliefs. The seals bear some kind of script which has not yet been deciphered.\n- The seals were produced mainly for commercial purpose. The seals were used by traders to stamp their goods. After a bag with goods was tied, a layer of wet clay was applied on the knot, and the seal was pressed on it leaving an impression. If the bag reached its destination with its seal intact, it indicated that it had not been tampered with. It also conveyed the identity of the sender or the owner. These seals were found in different regions. This indicates that the Harappan trade had spread over a vast area.\n\n(i) Name any two materials used to make Harappan seals. [1]\n(ii) State two ways in which the seals provide information about Harappan trade. [2]\n(iii) Explain the religious significance of the Pashupati Seal. [2]",

It has a large rectangular tank in a courtyard surrounded by a corridor on all four sides. There are two flights of steps, one in the north and the other in the south leading into the tank. To make the pool watertight, burnt bricks and mortar lined with bitumen and gypsum were used for construction. The water for the bath was provided by a well in an adjacent room. Surrounding the bath, were porticos and sets of rooms, and a stairway which led to an upper storey... This structure, with several distinctive features, has led scholars to suggest that it was meant for some kind of a ritual bath.\nThe construction of the Great Bath indicates that the art of building had reached a high degree of perfection at that time. The massive structure points out that there might have existed a ruling class that could mobilise labour, collect taxes and build such a huge structure for the public. Most of the scholars agree that the Great Bath might have been used for religious purposes.\n\n(i) Where was the Great Bath discovered? [1]\n(ii) State two features of its construction that made the pool watertight. [2]\n(iii) Explain two inferences that can be drawn about the Harappan civilisation from the study of the Great Bath.

According to these scholars, the Harappan Civilisation was an offshoot of the Mesopotamian Civilisation. However, excavations at various Harappan sites have indicated striking differences between the Harappan and the Mesopotamian Civilisations.\nSome scholars also held the view that trade with Mesopotamia played an important role in the transformation of the Harappan Civilisation from the early stage to the mature phase. But this theory has been rejected on the ground that no evidence of trade with Mesopotamia during the early Harappan period has been found.\nIndigenous Origin: The recent researches show that roots of the Harappan Civilisation lie deep in the Indian soil. According to some historians, the urban Harappan culture was only an outgrowth of the extensive local village cultures and not of foreign origin. These cultures probably contributed to the growth of the Harappan Civilisation, together with the external stimulus provided by trade contacts with Mesopotamia. These historians found some marked similarities between the pre-Harappan and proto-Harappan cultures at Kot Diji, Amri and Kalibangan in terms of granary, defensive walls and long distance trade in these settlements. From this, historians concluded that the Harappan Civilisation evolved from these agricultural communities.'\n\n(a) Name the two primary theories regarding the origin of the Harappan Civilisation mentioned in the passage. [2]\n(b) Explain the argument used to reject the theory that Mesopotamian trade was the primary catalyst for the mature Harappan phase. [3]\n(c) Elaborate on the 'Indigenous Origin' theory. What specific archaeological evidence from pre-Harappan sites is cited to support this theory? [5]",

Indigenous Origin (an outgrowth of local village cultures).\n\n(b) The theory that trade with Mesopotamia was the main catalyst for the transformation to the mature Harappan phase has been rejected because there is no evidence of trade with Mesopotamia during the early Harappan period. The absence of this crucial link in its formative stage undermines the theory.\n\n(c) The 'Indigenous Origin' theory posits that the urban Harappan culture was not imported but evolved from extensive local village and agricultural communities within the Indian subcontinent. It is seen as an outgrowth of these native cultures, possibly stimulated by some external trade contacts. \nThe specific evidence supporting this includes marked similarities between pre-Harappan/proto-Harappan cultures and the mature Harappan Civilisation. Archaeologists have found features like granaries, defensive walls, and evidence of long-distance trade in pre-Harappan settlements at sites such as Kot Diji, Amri, and Kalibangan, suggesting a continuous evolution.",

This dockyard is believed to be one of the oldest dockyards in the world. It was surrounded by a massive brick wall, probably as a protection against floods. The dockyard, made of baked bricks, was connected by channels to the Gulf of Cambay. Archaeologists have also found the remains of stone anchors, marine shells and seals, which can be traced to the Persian Gulf. These, along with a structure identified as a warehouse, strongly suggest that Lothal was a port with a dockyard. According to the historians, the town planners here had studied tides in detail to be able to leverage connecting rivers at high tide for ships to come into the port. The dockyard is most scientifically designed to withstand the flow of water and its current. It also had a water locking to keep the water in... Lothal was an important trading and manufacturing centre of the Indus Valley civilisation and was used for carrying out overseas trade. The dockyard... testifies the hydraulic knowledge of the Harappans.'\n\n(a) At which site was the dockyard discovered? State any two archaeological findings, other than the dockyard structure itself, that confirm its function as a trading port. [3]\n(b) Describe two features of the Lothal dockyard that demonstrate the advanced hydraulic knowledge of the Harappans. [4]\n(c) Based on the passage, explain the overall significance of the Lothal dockyard for understanding the Harappan economy and its external relations. [3]",

The remains of stone anchors, marine shells, and seals traceable to the Persian Gulf.\n2. The identification of a structure as a warehouse near the dockyard.\n\n(b) Two features that demonstrate advanced hydraulic knowledge are:\n1. The town planners had studied tides in detail. They designed the dockyard to be connected to rivers in a way that allowed ships to enter during high tide, showing a sophisticated understanding of tidal patterns.\n2. The dockyard had a water locking system to keep the water level stable within the dock, and it was scientifically designed to withstand the flow and current of water. This points to advanced engineering skills.\n\n(c) The significance of the Lothal dockyard is immense. Firstly, it provides concrete evidence of large-scale overseas trade, proving the Harappan civilisation was not isolated. Secondly, the discovery of seals traceable to the Persian Gulf confirms commercial links with other contemporary civilisations like Mesopotamia. Thirdly, it establishes Lothal as a crucial trading and manufacturing hub, which is key to understanding the complex, urbanised Harappan economy. Finally, it testifies to their high level of scientific and engineering (hydraulic) knowledge.",

According to Mortimer Wheeler in the last phase of Mohenjo-daro, men, women and children were massacred in the streets and houses as is evident from the skeletons of 13 males and females and one child found lying in a room.\n\nAccording to renowned historians, D.P. Agarwal and Sood, the Harappan civilisation declined because of increasing aridity in the area and the drying up of the river Ghaggar. Sutlej and Yamuna used to be the tributaries of the river Ghaggar and because of some tectonic disturbances, the Sutlej stream was captured by the Indus river and the Yamuna shifted east to join the Ganges. This change left the Ghaggar waterless. The ecological disturbance caused by the increased aridity and shift in the drainage pattern led to the decline of the Harappan civilisation.\n\nSince the Indus valley civilisation was a Bronze Age culture, enormous quantities of wood were needed to produce bronze. Wood was also needed to produce jewellery, to bake bricks, pottery, stoneware and to make boats and furniture. This could have led to deforestation leading to climatic change in the region.\n---\n\n(i) Name the two historians/scholars mentioned in the passage who proposed the 'Attack' theory and the 'Increased Aridity' theory respectively. [2]\n(ii) Explain the chain of events that led to the decline of the Harappan civilisation, according to the 'Increased Aridity' theory. [4]\n(iii) Although the Harappan Civilisation declined physically, its legacy continued. In this context, explain any four aspects of its heritage that were adopted by later civilisations. [4]",

This caused the Sutlej to be captured by the Indus river and the Yamuna to shift east to join the Ganges.\n3. As a result, the Ghaggar river, of which they were tributaries, dried up and was left waterless.\n4. This ecological disturbance, caused by the shift in the drainage pattern and increasing aridity, led to the decline of the civilisation.\n\n(iii) Four aspects of the Harappan heritage that continued in later civilisations are:\n1. **Technology and Crafts:** The Harappan way of making baked pottery, bricks, beads, jewellery, and textiles was adopted by later cultures.\n2. **Agriculture:** The cultivation of cotton, a remarkable achievement of the Harappans, was later adopted by other civilisations like the Egyptians.\n3. **Religious Worship:** The worship of deities like Pashupati Shiva and the Mother Goddess continued.\n4. **Religious Beliefs and Symbols:** The worship of sacred trees, animals, serpents, and the use of religious symbols prevalent in Harappan times have continued to this day.",

Lothal, Surkotada and Balakot were some of the important trading coastal towns which carried on trade with Mesopotamia and other West Asian sites... The Mesopotamian records from about 2350 BC onwards refer to trade relations with Meluha, which was the ancient name given to the Indus region. The Mesopotamian texts refer to two intermediate trading stations called Dilmun and Makan, which lay between Mesopotamia and Meluha. Dilmun has been identified with Bahrain on the Persian Gulf. Possibly the trade with these countries used to be carried out by sea. Mesopotamian texts refer to Meluha as a land of seafarers. Besides, the depictions of ships and boats on seals also indicate this... A rectangular dockyard was discovered at Lothal in Gujarat... It was surrounded by a massive brick wall, probably as a protection against floods. The dockyard, made of baked bricks, was connected by channels to the Gulf of Cambay.\n---\n\n(i) What ancient name did Mesopotamian records use for the Indus region? Name one of the intermediate trading stations mentioned in the texts. [2]\n(ii) State any three pieces of evidence mentioned in the passage and your syllabus that prove the Harappans carried out overseas trade. [3]\n(iii) Explain the significance of the discovery of the dockyard at Lothal in understanding the Harappan Civilisation. [5]",
          "model_answer_text": "(i) The ancient name for the Indus region in Mesopotamian records was 'Meluha'. One intermediate trading station was 'Dilmun' (or Makan).\n\n(ii) Three pieces of evidence for overseas trade are:\n1. Mesopotamian records refer to Meluha (the Indus region) as a 'land of seafarers' and mention trade relations.\n2. Depictions of ships and boats have been found on Harappan seals.\n3. A massive brick dockyard, connected to the Gulf of Cambay, was discovered at Lothal, proving it was a port for trade.\n(Also acceptable: Discovery of stone anchors, marine shells, and seals traced to the Persian Gulf at Lothal.)\n\n(iii) The discovery of the dockyard at Lothal is significant for several reasons:\n1. **Evidence of Trade:** It confirms that Lothal was a major port and an important trading and manufacturing centre, providing concrete evidence of overseas trade with regions like Mesopotamia.\n2. **Engineering Skill:** The scientific design of the dockyard, built to withstand tides and currents with a water-locking system, testifies to the advanced hydraulic knowledge and engineering skills of the Harappans.\n3. **Economic Understanding:** The presence of a warehouse nearby suggests a well-organized system for storing goods for trade, providing insight into their economic structure.\n4. **Maritime Activities:** It proves that the Harappans were skilled seafarers, as mentioned in Mesopotamian texts, and had a coastal trade route linking various sites.\n5. **Urban Planning:** It highlights the sophisticated planning of Harappan cities, where specific structures like dockyards were built to facilitate economic activities.",

[2]\n(c) Mesopotamian records refer to trade with 'Meluha', identified as the Indus region.

          "model_answer_text": "(a) Two materials used to make seals were terracotta and steatite. (Also acceptable: agate).\n(b) The seals were used by traders to stamp their goods. After a bag of goods was tied, a layer of wet clay was applied to the knot. The seal was then pressed on it, leaving an impression. If the bag reached its destination with its seal intact, it indicated that it had not been tampered with. It also conveyed the identity of the sender.\n(c) This suggests that the Harappans had commercial contacts with their western neighbours, including Mesopotamia. It indicates that the Harappan trade was not just internal but also external (overseas trade). The Mesopotamian reference to 'Meluha' as a 'land of seafarers' and the discovery of seals in other regions proves that Harappan trade had spread over a vast area.",

          "model_answer_text": "Based on the evidence from the Great Bath, Granaries, and the Citadel, the following features of the Harappan political and administrative system can be deduced:\n\n1.  **Existence of a Centralised Ruling Class:** The construction of massive public structures like the Great Bath and large Granaries, along with the division of the city into a fortified 'Citadel' for the elite and a 'lower town' for the general populace, strongly indicates the presence of a powerful ruling class. The text mentions that the Citadel had houses of the 'ruling class' and that the Great Bath's scale implies an authority that could \"mobilise labour, collect taxes and build such a huge structure for the public.\" This points to a centralised government capable of large-scale project management and resource collection.\n\n2.  **Efficient Civic Planning and Administration:** The Harappan administration was highly efficient and focused on civic amenities. The meticulous planning of the Great Bath, making it watertight with advanced materials like bitumen and providing a systematic water supply, showcases high engineering and planning skills. Similarly, building granaries on raised platforms with ventilation to protect grains from floods and mildew indicates a concern for public food security. The use of standardised bricks across different sites for these constructions further implies the existence of a central administrative body that enforced standards and oversaw public works.",

          "model_answer_text": "The theories of 'Deforestation' and 'Increased Aridity' are not mutually exclusive and can be seen as part of a single, interconnected process of environmental degradation that led to the decline of the Harappan Civilisation.\n\n1.  **Deforestation as a Trigger for Climatic Change:** The text states that as a Bronze Age culture, the Harappans required \"enormous quantities of wood\" for smelting metal, baking bricks and pottery, and for construction. This large-scale consumption of wood could have led to widespread deforestation. The text directly suggests a cause-effect relationship by stating this deforestation could have led to \"climatic change in the region.\" A significant climatic change resulting from the loss of forest cover is often a reduction in rainfall and an increase in temperature, which directly contributes to a state of 'Increased Aridity'.\n\n2.  **Deforestation Exacerbating Water Scarcity:** The theory of 'Increased Aridity' points to the drying up of the Ghaggar river system as a major cause of decline. While tectonic shifts are mentioned as a reason, the effects would have been severely worsened by deforestation. Forests play a crucial role in the hydrological cycle by helping to retain rainwater and regulate river flow. The removal of forests from the river's catchment area would have led to increased soil erosion, faster water runoff, and a reduced capacity of the ground to hold water, thus accelerating the drying up of the river and intensifying the arid conditions mentioned in the other theory.",

Its scientific design, along with finds like Persian Gulf seals and stone anchors, indicates advanced hydraulic knowledge and facilitated large-scale overseas trade with distant lands like Mesopotamia.\n\n2.  **Evidence from Artefacts:** The discovery of over 2000 Harappan seals, many found far from the Indus Valley in West Asian sites like Mesopotamia.\n    *   **Significance:** These seals were used for commercial purposes to stamp goods. An intact impression on a clay seal identified the sender and assured the buyer that the goods were not tampered with.
