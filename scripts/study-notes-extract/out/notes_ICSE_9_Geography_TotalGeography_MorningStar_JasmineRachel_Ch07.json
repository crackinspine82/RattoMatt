The **hot lava** together with **ash** and **dust** destroy not only human beings, but also animals as well as plant life.\n2.  Agricultural fields are covered with layers of volcanic **ash** and **dust** making them unsuitable for cultivation.\n3.  Huge clouds are formed after the eruption of volcanoes causing heavy rains which result in **floods** and **landslides**.\n4.  Volcanoes also emit **poisonous gases** which pollute the environment and cause health problems.\n5.  Explosive volcanoes in ocean islands are followed by high **Tsunami waves**. They flood the area and destroy property, people, animals and crops."
