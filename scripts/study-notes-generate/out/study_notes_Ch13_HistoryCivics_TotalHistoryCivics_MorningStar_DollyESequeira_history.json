      "content_md": "After the **Renaissance** and the **Reformation**, Englishmen began to enjoy the freedom of thought and expression. There was scope for experimentation, and the government did not interfere in their daily life. In this atmosphere, Englishmen thought of new methods of production in different fields. The large number of inventions made by the British scientists brought about a revolution in industry in England.\n\nInvention of machinery and its use in manufacturing was the starting point of the Industrial Revolution. **John Key**, a weaver of Lancashire, invented **'The Flying Shuttle'** which increased the speed of weaving. It also made the weaving of broad cloth by one person possible. A Lancashire weaver named **James Hargreaves** invented a machine called the **Spinning Jenny**. It could spin eight threads at a time instead of one thread of the old-fashioned spinning wheel.\n\nYarn spun on the Jenny was not very strong. Then, **Richard Arkwright** invented the **'Water Frame'**. It produced harder and stronger yarn than that of the Spinning Jenny, but it was run by water power. It ushered in the factory system.\n\n[Image: Spinning Jenny]"

      "level_label": "Topic",
      "content_md": "Natural resources such as iron and coal were available in England. The iron and coal mines were situated close to each other. Iron was used in making machines. The coal provided cheap fuel. Both these factors helped in the development of industries."

      "title": "Increase in the Demand for Goods",
      "level_label": "Topic",
      "content_md": "The incentive to produce more and more goods was provided by two factors. First, the huge profits of expanding trade provided an impetus to discover new ways of increasing her production. Second, the **Napoleonic wars** made the English industries quite active. The Napoleonic wars damaged trade and industry of the continental countries. Since these wars were never fought in Britain, the long period of peace in Britain proved conducive to industrial production."

      "level_label": "Topic",
      "content_md": "The feudal system broke down and the **Agrarian Revolution** preceded the Industrial Revolution in England. As a result, a large number of peasants were unemployed who shifted to cities. So many labourers were available in England to be employed in the factories."

      "level_label": "Topic",
      "content_md": "A good transport system is necessary for effective trade and commerce. In the second half of the 18th century, the transport system in England was adequate. The use of tarcoal and tar enabled the construction of roads in many European countries. Steamboats and steamships were used extensively. **George Stephenson** designed his first locomotive engine, which was used for hauling coal in the Killingworth colliery. This brought about a revolution in transport."

      "title": "CAPITALISM",
      "level_label": "Topic",
      "content_md": "It is difficult to separate capitalism from Industrial Revolution. Industrial Revolution could not have taken place without the means of carrying on the production by machines. It was eventually realised that wealth could be used for generating more wealth which came to be called **capital**.\n\nThe owners of the capital became the **capitalists**. The economic system which generates and gives power to capitalists came to be known as **capitalism**. The capitalists not only provide money for buying machines, tools, implements and raw material but also promote further research to develop improved machines.\n\n[Image: Richard Arkwright]\n\nIn England, the first machines to be used were those of weaving and spinning. A travelling barber, **Richard Arkwright** understood the economic potential of using machines ‘to clothe’ millions of people. From the word ‘to clothe’ its Latin **‘investire’** gave rise to a new term called **investment** which means acquisition of financial or productive assets with the help of the capital.\n\n**Capital** came to be defined as the money which is invested for producing different articles in a factory, for buying machinery and raw material and for selling finished goods in the market.\n\nIn capitalism, the means of production such as labour, raw material, tools and machines are owned and controlled by private individuals or groups of them. A significant development was that it also included rent of land and wages of the labour as well as the interest on the wealth invested. With profit as the sole motive, the scientists and inventors too benefitted. They started the system of patenting their inventions and obtained the best price."

      "level_label": "Point",
      "content_md": "The Industrial Revolution increased the national wealth, raised the standard of living, and made life more comfortable. All this helped in checking the onslaught of various diseases, leading to an increase in population. More people moved into urban areas where factories were located. The rural population had risen sharply as new sources of food became available, and death rates declined due to fewer plagues and wars. Simultaneously, many small farms disappeared, causing people from rural areas to migrate to urban areas for employment, education, and better freedom."

      "content_md": "The **new enclosure law** required farmers to put fences or hedges around their fields to prevent common grazing on the land. Small farmers who could not afford to enclose their fields had to sell out their farms to larger landholders and search for work elsewhere. These factors combined to provide a ready workforce for the new industries."

      "level_label": "Point",
      "content_md": "New manufacturing towns and cities grew dramatically. Many of these cities were located close to the coalfields that supplied fuel to the factories. Factories had to be close to sources of power because power could not be distributed very far. The names of British factory cities soon symbolised industrialisation to the wider world: **Liverpool, Birmingham, Leeds, Glasgow, Sheffield** and especially **Manchester**."

      "content_md": "Mass production destroyed the domestic system of production. The growth of industries and the use of huge machines gave rise to factories. People from villages shifted to towns for employment in the factories. This in turn led to the growth of new towns in England such as **Manchester, Birmingham, Sheffield and Leeds**. It made modern civilisation essentially urban in character."

      "content_md": "Small farmers who cultivated land and manufactured goods in their spare time in their homes shifted to new industrial towns. They were forced to seek employment in factories because they were replaced by big landlords. In pre-industrial England, more than three-quarters of the population lived in small villages. By the mid-19th century, the country became the first nation with half its population in cities. By 1850, millions of British people lived in crowded, grim industrial cities."

      "content_md": "The movement of people away from agriculture and into industrial cities brought great stress on the labour force. Women in households, who had earned income from spinning, found the new factories taking away their source of income. Traditional handloom weavers could no longer compete with the mechanised production of cloth. Skilled labourers lost their jobs as new machines replaced them."

      "title": "Exploitation",
      "level_label": "Point",
      "content_md": "In the factories, people had to work long hours under harsh conditions. Factory owners and managers paid the minimum amount necessary for a workforce, often recruiting women and children to tend the machines because they could be hired for very low wages. This exploitation, particularly the use of child labour, soon faced criticism."

    {
      "title": "Stress and Strain",
      "level_label": "Point",
      "content_md": "The nature of work changed due to the **division of labour**. This idea involved dividing the production process into basic, individual tasks. Each worker performed one task repetitively. While this improved productivity, many factory jobs were boring. Workers laboured for long hours, often more than 12-14 hours a day, six days a week. They faced strict rules, close supervision, and unsafe conditions, which often led to serious or fatal accidents. The clock-ruled life in the mills caused significant stress."

      "title": "Overcrowding",
      "level_label": "Point",
      "content_md": "People moved from small villages to work in factories located in cities, which became overcrowded and unsanitary. The working poor lived in crowded areas in shoddy houses and tenements, often with multiple family members sharing a single bed. Pollution followed population growth. The air was fouled by fumes from fossil fuels like coal and wood, leading to occupational diseases. Sewage and industrial discharge polluted rivers and streams, tainting water supplies.\n\nHowever, by about the 1820s, income levels for most workers began to improve. The economy expanded at a rate more than twice what it had been before the Industrial Revolution. Although vast differences existed between the rich and the poor, most of the population enjoyed some benefits of economic growth, and the widespread poverty and threat of mass starvation of the pre-industrial age were reduced."

      "content_md": "The birth of **Socialism** was one of the important consequences of the Industrial Revolution. Efforts were made to improve the working conditions of the labourers.\n\nIn 1776, the Scottish economist **Adam Smith**, in his *Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations*, found no conflict between the self-interest of capitalists and the common good. He argued they should operate without State interference.\n\nHe propounded the doctrine of **‘Laissez faire’**, which translates to ‘leave alone’. Adam Smith strongly opposed State interference in the economy. The antithesis of the Laissez faire doctrine was socialism, which visualised a society free from exploitation.\n\n[Image: Adam Smith]"

      "content_md": "Different writers have defined 'Socialism' differently, but almost all have visualised an active role for the State in the economy. **Babeuf**, an early Socialist thinker, envisioned a republic of equals open to all mankind.\n\n**Socialism** is defined as an economic system in which the means of production are owned not by private individuals but by the community in order that all may share more fairly in the wealth produced.\n\nThe evil effects of Capitalism and the desire to improve workers' conditions gave birth to socialism. Its ultimate goal is to eliminate the class struggle between capitalists and workers and form a classless society. To achieve this, government control over production and distribution is considered necessary.\n\nSocialism is based on three principles:\n(i) It is opposed to private capitalism.\n(ii) It is the voice of all workers and the working class.\n(iii) It demands a just distribution of wealth.\n\nThe **Laissez faire** doctrine was never fully practiced. Even England required the State to undertake public works and health programmes. Today, many forms of Socialism exist, with the degree of State control varying."

Capitalists, driven by selfish interests, exploited workers with low wages and long hours. They amassed great wealth and led luxurious lives at the workers' expense. The widening gulf between the rich becoming richer and the poor becoming poorer created social disharmony and led to a struggle between the two classes. Socialists took up the cause of the workers to save them from exploitation."

      "level_label": "Subtopic",
      "content_md": "**Karl Marx** (1818-83) was a German political philosopher and economist. His longtime associate **Frederick Engels** (1820-1895), whom he met in France in 1844, was his collaborator. They prepared a charter of Demands for the German Communist League, which later became the **Communist Manifesto**, published in 1848. Another famous book by Marx and Engels is **Das Kapital**. Marx completed the first volume before his death in 1883; Engels published the remaining two volumes later.\n\n[Image: Karl Marx]\n[Image: Frederick Engels]\n[Image: Lenin]\n\nKarl Marx viewed capitalist society as divided between two classes: the working class, which produces all value, and the owning class, which exploits that value for profit. This leads to a **class struggle**. Marx predicted this struggle would lead to a crisis, causing the collapse of the capitalist system. The working class would then take over power and organise production for its own benefit. This new society would be **'socialist'** in nature, without exploitation.\n\nThe system behind this society is known as **'Marxist Socialism'**. In a socialist society, private property in the means of production would be replaced by co-operative ownership. Production would be based on satisfying human needs, not on creating private profits. Eventually, Socialism would give way to **Communism**: a classless, stateless system based on common ownership and maximum individual freedom.\n\nAfter Marx's death, a new democratic Socialism emerged. **Bernstein** disagreed with the principle of class struggle, arguing that socialist objectives should be achieved through democratic means.\n\nThe revolutionary movement in Russia overthrew the Czarist regime in 1917, with **Lenin** and **Trotsky** as chief organisers. On October 1, 1949, a Communist regime was established in China under **Mao Tse-tung**. In India, socialist parties also emerged. In 1934, the Socialist party was established under the leadership of **Acharya Narendra Dev**, **Achyut Patwardhan**, **Jayaprakash Narayan** and **Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia**.\n\nIn the present scenario there seems to be a balance between Capitalism and Socialism. Socialism now has the connotation for working further for the promotion of a just **Welfare State**. Socialists now concentrate on such issues as protection against unemployment, illness and injury. They also pay special attention to provide old-age pension. Whatever may be the principles, mankind is marching towards establishing a just and benevolent State.\n\n### Comparative Study Between Capitalism and Socialism\n\n| Capitalism | Socialism |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| Refers to the economic system in which the means of production like labour, raw material, tools and machines are owned by private individuals or groups of them for profit. | Refers to the economic system in which the government owns and controls the means of production (as factories) and distribution of goods. |\n| Believes in free market and is opposed to government intervention in economics because it believes that government intervention introduces inefficiencies. | Believes that all individuals should have access to basic articles of consumption and public goods to allow for self-actualisation. |\n| Key proponents include Richard Cantillon, Adam Smith, David Ricardo, Fredrich A. Hayek, Ayn Rand, Milton Friedman. | Key proponents include Robert Owen, Pierre Leroux, Karl Marx, Fredrick Engels, John Stuart Mill, Albert Einstein, George Bernard Shaw. |\n| Production is for **profit**: useful goods and services are a by-product of pursuing profit. | Production is for **use**: useful goods and services are produced specifically for their usefulness. |\n| Competition for ownership of capital drives economic activity and creates a price system that determines resource allocation; profits are reinvested in the economy. | Economic activity and production especially are adjusted by the State to meet human needs and economic demands. |\n| Private property in capital and other goods is the dominant form of property. | Two kinds of property: **Personal property**, such as houses, clothing, etc. owned by the individual. **Public property** includes factories, and means of production owned by the State but with worker control. |\n| Production decisions are driven by consumer demand. Individuals choose what to consume and this choice leads to more competition and better products and services. | Production decisions are driven more by the State than by consumer demand. These decisions are made on the basis of human consumption needs and economic demands. |\n| It relies on markets to determine investment, production, and distribution decisions. | It relies on planning to determine investment and production decisions. Planning may be centralised or decentralised. |\n| Examples of countries where Capitalism is the predominant economic system are the USA, the UK, Canada, Australia. | Examples of countries where Socialism is prevalent are China, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Norway. |"
