This was done by the **Government of India Act of 1858** which had the following provisions:\n\n1.  It transferred the power to govern India from the **East India Company** to the **British Crown**.\n2.  The Company's **Board of Control** and **Court of Directors** were abolished. A member of the British Cabinet was appointed **Secretary of State for India** and made responsible for all matters related to the governance of India. He was given a Council to advise him, called the **Indian Council**. Thus, the ultimate power over India remained with the **British Parliament**.\n3.  Actual governance was to be carried on, as before, by the **Governor-General** who was also given the title of **Viceroy**, that is, a personal representative of the Crown. **Lord Canning** was appointed as the first Viceroy under this Act.\n4.  Appointments to the **Civil Service** were to be made by **open competition** under rules made by the Secretary of State."

They alienated the people from their rulers by giving them special protection and concessions.\n\nDuring the **First War of Independence**, both the Hindus and the Muslims showed great enthusiasm and zeal to fight against the alien government. But after the Uprising, the gulf between the two communities widened. This was the consequence of the British policy of **‘Divide and Rule’** by which they sowed the seeds of dissension between the two communities. It was a deliberate attempt so that the two communities might never come together to pose a threat to the **British rule in India**.\n\nThe Government cleverly used the attractions of **government service** to create a split along religious lines among the **educated Indians**. The British also encouraged **hatred and ill-feeling** among the Hindus and the Muslims so that they could never challenge the **British Empire in India**."

According to him, the Uprising began as a fight for religion and ended as a War of Independence as the revolutionaries wanted to get rid of the alien government and restore the old order of which the King of Delhi was the rightful representative.\n\nWhatever be the nature of the Uprising of 1857, it is generally hailed as the **First War of Independence**, because:\n1. It was the **first mass Uprising** in which all the sections of Indian society participated against a common enemy, i.e., the British.\n2.
