      "level_label": "Section",
      "content_md": "The earth is made up of several concentric layers. The outer layer is the earth's crust—the **lithosphere**. Parts of the earth's crust that are immersed under the oceans and seas form the **hydrosphere**. Extending upwards, the earth is enveloped by a blanket of gases which make up the **atmosphere**.\n\nOur knowledge about the interior of the earth comes not from excavations and explorations but from the study of seismic waves, materials thrown up by volcanoes, and evidence from theories of the origin of the earth. Seismic instruments record earthquake waves, enabling scientists to know about the density, pressure, and temperature of the interior. The study of molten material from volcanoes, meteorites, and heat from radioactive elements deep inside the earth also helps estimate the temperature and composition of the interior.\n\n[Image: Fig. 4.1.

      "content_md": "*   The **Lithosphere** or the outermost crust of the earth is the thinnest layer.\n*   It is made up of rocks with a large content of silicates, feldspar, mica etc.\n*   The Lithosphere can be divided into two broad divisions: the **SIAL** and **SIMA**.\n*   **Sial** appears to float above **Sima** because it has less density.\n*   The name **Sial** is taken from **Silica (Si)** and **Aluminium (Al)**. **Sima** is named after **Silica (Si)** and **Magnesium (Mg)**.\n*   **Sial** layer forms the continents, while **Sima** makes up the Ocean floor.\n\n[Image: Fig. 4.2.

      "level_label": "Topic",
      "content_md": "The core of the earth is called **NIFE**. It is made up of **Nickle (Ni)** and **Iron (Fe)**. Since these are heavy metals, having high density, they are found deep inside the earth.\n\n*   It is the most inaccessible part lying at the centre of the earth.\n*   The core is the densest part of the earth.\n*   It is also divided into **outer** and **inner core**.\n*   The entire core is about 7000 km in diameter.\n*   The temperature ranges from about 4400°C to about 6000°C.\n*   It is generally believed that the core is composed of iron and nickel which is responsible for earth's magnetism. The magnetic field is oriented towards North and South Poles.\n*   The solid state of the **inner core** is due to high density and pressure which have compressed the molten rock material. The S-waves disappear in the **outer core**, which suggests it is in a molten state."

      "content_md": "*   This layer lies below the crust.\n*   Its average thickness is 2900 km and makes up 84 per cent of the earth's total volume.\n*   The mantle is divided into two parts—the **upper mantle** and the **lower mantle**. The upper mantle extends from the Moho Discontinuity to a depth of 700 km. It is cooler and made of solid rocks. The lower mantle extends from 700 km to 2900 km.\n*   The lower mantle is hotter and denser than the upper mantle.\n*   At the depth of around 100-410 km, the mantle is partially molten and is known as **asthenosphere**. The lower mantle is solid due to high pressure.\n*   As the pressure increases towards the interior of the earth, the density also increases.\n*   The temperature varies between about 1000°C to around 3,700°C.\n\n[Image: Fig. 4.3.

      "content_md": "The boundary between the mantle and the core or the mantle-core interface is known as the **Gutenberg Discontinuity**.\n\n*   It begins at the depth of 2800 km.\n*   Here there is an abrupt change in the seismic waves (generated by earthquakes or explosions) that travel through the earth. Primary seismic waves (**P waves**) decrease in velocity while secondary seismic waves (**S waves**) disappear completely.\n*   It is dense probably due to a greater percentage of iron."

      "title": "Crust or Lithosphere",
      "level_label": "Topic",
      "content_md": "*   The crust is called **Lithosphere** because it is a sphere of solid rocks (Lithos meaning stones or rocks). The crust is only 1% of earth's mass and contains all known life in the universe.\n*   The crust is a relatively thin layer of rocks with a thickness of 60 km below high mountains and just 5-10 km below the oceans.\n*   Considering the size of the earth, the crust is a relatively thin layer.\n*   The temperature of the upper part of the oceanic crust has been estimated at 0°C but it gradually starts rising towards the interior.\n*   The weight and pressure of rocks also starts increasing with depth.\n\nBecause of the continuous changes in the earth's crust due to forces of nature, the thickness of the lithosphere is very fragile. The **Theory of Continental Drift** put forward by **Wegener** in the early 20th century and the **Theory of Plate Tectonics** put forth in 1960s suggest that the earth's crust undergoes structural changes. Besides, the lateral movements give the earth a new shape though very slowly over millions of years."

      "level_label": "Topic",
      "content_md": "This discontinuity between the Crust and the Mantle is known as '**Moho Discontinuity**'. It was discovered by a Yugoslavian scientist **Andreaja Mohorovicic** in **1909**.\n\n*   It forms the boundary between the crust and the mantle.\n*   Like the crust it does not exist at a uniform depth. It is found at about 8 km beneath the oceans and about 32 km beneath the continents.\n*   It has the characteristics of both the upper layer (the crust) and its bottom layer (the Mantle)."
