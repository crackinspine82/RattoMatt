This region was home to three powerful kingdoms—the Cheras, the Pandyas and the Cholas. The most powerful of the three were the Cholas.\n\nThe Chola Empire which arose in the ninth century, brought under its control a large part of the peninsula. The Cholas developed a powerful navy which enabled them to develop India's sea-trade in the Indian Ocean and to conquer Sri Lanka and the Maldive Islands. By the end of the 9th century, the Cholas defeated the Pallavas of Kanchi and weakened the Pandyans bringing the Tamil country (Tondamandala) under their control."

There is a profusion of inscriptions that give meticulous details about administration, social life, and material culture... The Brihadeshwara Temple alone that was consecrated in 1010 CE by Rajaraja I has nearly a hundred inscriptions... the Cholas were also the first empire with grand commercial and territorial ambitions outside of the Indian subcontinent with a maritime outreach of expeditions, conquests or trade to Sri Lanka, the Maldives, China, Java/ Sumatra and southeast Asia.\" What was the effect of this grand empire on Sri Lanka and South-East Asia? Do we have evidence of the same?"

For centuries, Indian merchants had been trading with various parts of South-East Asia and southern China, through the **Straits of Malacca**, which was held by the kingdom of **Shrivijaya** (modern day Indonesia). As the merchants of Shrivijaya began creating problems for the Indian merchants, the Indian merchants appealed to Rajendra Chola for help. He sent out a huge navy and defeated the Shrivijaya king.

This region was home to three powerful kingdoms—the Cheras, the Pandyas and the Cholas. The most powerful of the three were the Cholas.\n\nThe Chola Empire which arose in the ninth century, brought under its control a large part of the peninsula. The Cholas developed a powerful navy which enabled them to develop India's sea-trade in the Indian Ocean and to conquer Sri Lanka and the Maldive Islands. By the end of the 9th century, the Cholas defeated the Pallavas of Kanchi and weakened the Pandyans bringing the Tamil country (Tondamandala) under their control."

There is a profusion of inscriptions that give meticulous details about administration, social life, and material culture... The Brihadeshwara Temple alone that was consecrated in 1010 CE by Rajaraja I has nearly a hundred inscriptions... the Cholas were also the first empire with grand commercial and territorial ambitions outside of the Indian subcontinent with a maritime outreach of expeditions, conquests or trade to Sri Lanka, the Maldives, China, Java/ Sumatra and southeast Asia.\" What was the effect of this grand empire on Sri Lanka and South-East Asia? Do we have evidence of the same?"
