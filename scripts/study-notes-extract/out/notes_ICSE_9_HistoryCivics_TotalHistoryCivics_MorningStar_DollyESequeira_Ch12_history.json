But with the passage of time, moral decay crept into some areas in the functioning of the Church. Some of the clergymen lacked proper education and some lived in luxury and neglected their religious duties. The priests promised salvation in exchange for fees. They could pronounce a marriage lawful or unlawful. In fact, there were fees for every transaction in life, from birth to death, fees for the peace of the soul and fees for the souls of the people dead long ago. These practices were severely criticised and opposed by the people. Desiderius Erasmus, a Dutch philosopher and humanist exposed them in his book named 'In Praise of Folly' and prepared the ground for the Reformation."

As early as the 13th century, the rulers of Europe had quarrelled with the Popes over the royal right to tax the Church property. The rivalry ended in the defeat of the Papacy.\n\nThe French King, Philip IV had forced Pope Clement V to leave his headquarters at Rome and stay in Avignon in France, when the latter interfered in the former's political affairs. King Henry VIII of England hardly cared for the Pope. He got the Church lands and in 1536 passed an Act for the dissolution of monasteries, whereby small monasteries with an income of less than £200 a year were closed and their buildings, land and money taken by the Crown. By another Act of 1539, larger monasteries were closed. The monasteries were a reminder of the power of the Catholic Church. Besides, the monasteries were the wealthiest institutions in the country. King Henry's lavish lifestyle, along with his wars, had led to a lack of money. By destroying the monastic system, Henry could acquire all its wealth and property, while at the same time removing the influence of the Pope."
