        "content_md": "The term 'Industrial Revolution' denotes all those changes that took place in the field of industry during the second half of the 18th century and the first half of the 19th century. Until this period, goods were manufactured at home with hand. However during the period of the Industrial Revolution, the employer made his workers to use machines in his factory. The employees were paid wages for their labour. The period marked a change from handwork to machine work and from domestic system to factory system of production.\n\nIn short, the Industrial Revolution is the name given to a series of changes that brought about a transition from production by hand to production by machine, from small-scale production to large-scale production, from handmade goods to machine-made goods.\n\nIndustrial Revolution was unlike any other revolution. It was not sudden, not violent; there was no bloodshed, nor loss to life and property. The Revolution was peaceful. It began in England around mid-eighteenth century by mass production of goods; and within a hundred years it brought in revolutionary changes in the political, social and economic life of the people."

Even England, one of its staunch supporters, could not do without the State taking up many of the initiatives specially the public works and public health programmes, which the capitalists under laissez faire could hardly do. On the other hand, many forms of Socialism exist today even after the break up of the erstwhile Union of Socialist Soviet Republics (USSR). Only the degree of State control varies from State to State."

The working class would take over power, organise production for its own benefit as a class. This new society would be **'socialist'** in nature, a society without exploitation. The system behind this society is known as **'Marxist Socialism'** or **'Socialism'** as conceived by Karl Marx himself. In a socialist society, **private property** in the means of production would be headed by **co-operative ownership**. A socialist economy would not base production on the creation of private profits, but would instead base production and economic activity on the criteria of satisfying human needs, i.e., production would be carried out directly for use. Eventually, Socialism would give way to a **Communism**, i.e., a classless, stateless system based on common ownership and free access and maximum freedom to individuals to develop their own capacities and talents.\n\n[Image: Karl Marx]"

Socialists now concentrate on such issues as protection against unemployment, illness and injury. They also pay special attention to provide old-age pension.

Until this period, goods were manufactured at home with hand. However during the period of the Industrial Revolution, the employer made his workers to use machines in his factory. The employees were paid wages for their labour. The period marked a change from handwork to machine work and from domestic system to factory system of production.\n\nIn short, the Industrial Revolution is the name given to a series of changes that brought about a transition from production by hand to production by machine, from small-scale production to large-scale production, from handmade goods to machine-made goods.\n\nIndustrial Revolution was unlike any other revolution. It was not sudden, not violent; there was no bloodshed, nor loss to life and property. The Revolution was peaceful. It began in England around mid-eighteenth century by mass production of goods; and within a hundred years it brought in revolutionary changes in the political, social and economic life of the people."
