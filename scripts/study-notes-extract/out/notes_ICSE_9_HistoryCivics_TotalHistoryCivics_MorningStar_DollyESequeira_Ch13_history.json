        "content_md": "The term 'Industrial Revolution' denotes all those changes that took place in the field of industry during the second half of the 18th century and the first half of the 19th century. Until this period, goods were manufactured at home with hand. However during the period of the Industrial Revolution, the employer made his workers to use machines in his factory. The employees were paid wages for their labour. The period marked a change from handwork to machine work and from domestic system to factory system of production.\n\nIn short, the Industrial Revolution is the name given to a series of changes that brought about a transition from production by hand to production by machine, from small-scale production to large-scale production, from handmade goods to machine-made goods.\n\nIndustrial Revolution was unlike any other revolution. It was not sudden, not violent; there was no bloodshed, nor loss to life and property. The Revolution was peaceful. It began in England around mid-eighteenth century by mass production of goods; and within a hundred years it brought in revolutionary changes in the political, social and economic life of the people."

        "content_md": "| Capitalism | Socialism |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| Capitalism refers to the economic system in which the means of production like labour, raw material, tools and machines are owned by private individuals or groups of them for profit. | Socialism refers to the economic system in which the government owns and controls the means of production (as factories) and distribution of goods. |\n| Capitalism believes in free market and is opposed to government intervention in economics because it believes that government intervention introduces inefficiencies. | It believes that all individuals should have access to basic articles of consumption and public goods to allow for self-actualisation. |\n| Key proponents of Capitalism include Richard Cantillon, Adam Smith, David Ricardo, Fredrich A. Hayek, Ayn Rand, Milton Friedman. | Key proponents of Socialism include Robert Owen, Pierre Leroux, Karl Marx, Fredrick Engels, John Stuart Mill, Albert Einstein, George Bernard Shaw. |\n| In Capitalism, production is for profit: useful goods and services are a by-product of pursuing profit. | In Socialism, production is for use: useful goods and services are produced specifically for their usefulness. |\n| Competition for ownership of capital drives economic activity and creates a price system that determines resource allocation; profits are reinvested in the economy. | Economic activity and production especially are adjusted by the State to meet human needs and economic demands. |\n| Private property in capital and other goods is the dominant form of property. | Two kinds of property: Personal property, such as houses, clothing, etc. owned by the individual. Public property includes factories, and means of production owned by the State but with worker control. |\n| Production decisions are driven by consumer demand. Individuals choose what to consume and this choice leads to more competition and better products and services. | Production decisions are driven more by the State than by consumer demand. These decisions are made on the basis of human consumption needs and economic demands. |\n| It relies on markets to determine investment, production, and distribution decisions. | It relies on planning to determine investment and production decisions. Planning may be centralised or decentralised. |\n| Examples of countries where Capitalism is the predominant economic system are the USA, the UK, Canada, Australia. | Examples of countries where Socialism is prevalent are China, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Norway. |"

It could spin eight threads at a time instead of one thread of the old-fashioned spinning wheel. Yarn spun on the Jenny was not very strong. Then, **Richard Arkwright** invented the **‘Water Frame’**. It produced harder and stronger yarn than that of the Spinning Jenny, but it was run by water power. It ushered in the **factory system**."

Because of his revolutionary ideas Marx had been compelled to leave Germany and make London his homeland. Both Marx and Engels lived in London. They had earlier prepared a charter of Demands or a Manifesto for the German Communist League. This document was later given the shape of *Communist Manifesto* published in 1848.

The working class would take over power, organise production for its own benefit as a class. This new society would be **'socialist'** in nature, a society without exploitation. The system behind this society is known as **'Marxist Socialism'** or **'Socialism'** as conceived by Karl Marx himself. In a socialist society, private property in the means of production would be headed by **co-operative ownership**. A socialist economy would not base production on the creation of private profits, but would instead base production and economic activity on the criteria of satisfying human needs, i.e., production would be carried out directly for use. Eventually, Socialism would give way to a **Communism**, i.e., a classless, stateless system based on common ownership and free access and maximum freedom to individuals to develop their own capacities and talents."

Until this period, goods were manufactured at home with hand. However during the period of the Industrial Revolution, the employer made his workers to use machines in his factory. The employees were paid wages for their labour. The period marked a change from handwork to machine work and from domestic system to factory system of production.\n\nIn short, the Industrial Revolution is the name given to a series of changes that brought about a transition from production by hand to production by machine, from small-scale production to large-scale production, from handmade goods to machine-made goods.\n\nIndustrial Revolution was unlike any other revolution. It was not sudden, not violent; there was no bloodshed, nor loss to life and property. The Revolution was peaceful. It began in England around mid-eighteenth century by mass production of goods; and within a hundred years it brought in revolutionary changes in the political, social and economic life of the people."

      "content_md": "| Capitalism | Socialism |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| Capitalism refers to the economic system in which the means of production like labour, raw material, tools and machines are owned by private individuals or groups of them for profit. | Socialism refers to the economic system in which the government owns and controls the means of production (as factories) and distribution of goods. |\n| Capitalism believes in free market and is opposed to government intervention in economics because it believes that government intervention introduces inefficiencies. | It believes that all individuals should have access to basic articles of consumption and public goods to allow for self-actualisation. |\n| Key proponents of Capitalism include Richard Cantillon, Adam Smith, David Ricardo, Fredrich A. Hayek, Ayn Rand, Milton Friedman. | Key proponents of Socialism include Robert Owen, Pierre Leroux, Karl Marx, Fredrick Engels, John Stuart Mill, Albert Einstein, George Bernard Shaw. |\n| In Capitalism, production is for profit: useful goods and services are a by-product of pursuing profit. | In Socialism, production is for use: useful goods and services are produced specifically for their usefulness. |\n| Competition for ownership of capital drives economic activity and creates a price system that determines resource allocation; profits are reinvested in the economy. | Economic activity and production especially are adjusted by the State to meet human needs and economic demands. |\n| Private property in capital and other goods is the dominant form of property. | Two kinds of property: Personal property, such as houses, clothing, etc. owned by the individual. Public property includes factories, and means of production owned by the State but with worker control. |\n| Production decisions are driven by consumer demand. Individuals choose what to consume and this choice leads to more competition and better products and services. | Production decisions are driven more by the State than by consumer demand. These decisions are made on the basis of human consumption needs and economic demands. |\n| It relies on markets to determine investment, production, and distribution decisions. | It relies on planning to determine investment and production decisions. Planning may be centralised or decentralised. |\n| Examples of countries where Capitalism is the predominant economic system are the USA, the UK, Canada, Australia. | Examples of countries where Socialism is prevalent are China, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Norway. |"
