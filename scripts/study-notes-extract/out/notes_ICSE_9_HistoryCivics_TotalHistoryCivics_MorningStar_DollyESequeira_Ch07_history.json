The example of Rajaraja was followed by his successors as well. Consequently, there exists a formal record of the transactions made by each Chola ruler.\n\nThe inscriptions of the Cholas are in the form of **Copper-plate grants**, **stone inscriptions** and inscriptions made on the **walls and pillars of temples**. The **Copper-plate grants** known as **Anbil** and **Karandi** as well as the **Kanyakumari stone inscription** give a long list of rulers indicating the origin of the Chola dynasty. Another set of **Copper-plate** contains 31 copper sheets. These plates are written in **Sanskrit** and **Tamil**. They record a grant made to a temple by **Rajendra Chola I**."

They record gifts and endowments to temples and brahmanas. **Copper-plate inscriptions** are the records of grants of villages, plots of land or other privileges to individuals or institutions by the Cholas. For example, the **Leyden grant** (so called as they are preserved in the Museum of Leyden in Holland) of **Parantaka Chola** and those of Parakesari Uttama Chola are among the most important.\n3.  They inform us about the construction of a temple or the setting up of a new image of the deity.\n4.  Some inscriptions have **royal orders** on taxation and land revenue, resolutions of village assemblies, judgements delivered against persons guilty of theft, murder and other crimes.\n5.  Inscriptions on temple walls served the purpose of **public registrations** such as the record of sales, mortgages and other forms of transfers of property rights in village lands."

India sent textiles, spices and precious stones to the West Asian countries. The people who came from Western Asia to trade in these goods were the Arab merchants, who exchanged money for goods. Foreigners brought wealth to India through their trade.\n\nRajaraja was aware of the importance of controlling the sea. He decided to show his strength along the coasts of South India. So, he took out a **naval expedition** and attacked both **Sri Lanka** and the **Maldive Islands**. He conquered the northern half of Sri Lanka.\n\nHe built the **Rajarajeshwara temple** of Lord Shiva at **Thanjavur**. On the walls of this temple are inscribed the main works of Rajaraja I. Under his rule, the **Cholas** became the supreme power in Southern India. The increase in trade brought prosperity to their kingdom, **Cholamandal**. In fact, the word, **Coromandel** has been derived from **Cholamandal**."

The Chola army defeated **Mahipala, king of Bengal**. To commemorate this victory, he adopted the title of **Gangaikonda** and built a new capital called **Gangaikonda-Cholapuram** in the present State of Tamil Nadu.\n\nHis most daring campaign was in **South-East Asia**. For centuries, Indian merchants had been trading with various parts of South-East Asia and southern China, through the **Straits of Malacca**, which was held by the kingdom of **Shrivijaya** (modern day Indonesia). As the merchants of Shrivijaya began creating problems for the Indian merchants, the Indian merchants appealed to **Rajendra Chola** for help. He sent out a huge navy and defeated the **Shrivijaya king**. As a result, Indian trade with South-East Asia and southern China continued, thereby greatly enriching the Chola kingdom. He built magnificent palaces and beautiful temples at his new capital **Gangaikonda-Cholapuram**.\n\n[Image: Vimana of Brihadeshwara Temple]"
