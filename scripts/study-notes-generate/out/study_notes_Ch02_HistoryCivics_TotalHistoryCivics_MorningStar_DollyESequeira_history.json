While Rig Vedic people knew of a metal called **ayas** (copper or bronze), Later Vedic literature mentions **Shyama** or **Krishna ayas** (black metal) to denote iron. Iron was harder, cheaper, and more plentiful than copper and bronze. Its uses included:\n\n*   **(i) Agriculture:** Iron tools helped clear dense rain forests in northern and eastern India, converting them to cultivable land. Iron plough-heads, sickles, and hoes allowed for cultivation of vast tracts of land. This led to the expansion of settlements like **Hastinapur** and **Kaushambi** and increased production of rice, wheat, and barley.\n*   **(ii) Occupation:** The use of iron led to new trades with durable implements like saws, chisels, hammers, nails, and tongs. This supported occupations like weaving, spinning, carpentry, and tool-making.\n*   **(iii) Defence:** Due to its durability and availability, iron was extensively used for making weapons like swords, armours, and shields.\n\n[Image: Iron Implements]"

Das** argued that Aryans originated in the Sapta Sindhu region and migrated outwards.\n*   **Tibet:** **Swami Dayanand Saraswati** believed Tibet was the original home of the Aryans.\n*   **Central Asia:** Professor **Max Mueller** proposed the Central Asian theory, which is widely accepted by many historians for the following reasons:\n    1.  The land in Asia Minor was fertile and suitable for agriculture and animal domestication.\n    2.  Stone inscriptions in Asia Minor show that Aryan gods like Indra and Varuna were worshipped there.\n    3.  Flora and fauna mentioned in the Rig Veda are found in Asia Minor.\n    4.  Asia Minor is equidistant from Europe and India.\n    5.

This region, covering present-day eastern Afghanistan, Punjab, and parts of Western Uttar Pradesh, was later named **Brahmavarta** ('land of the Gods').
