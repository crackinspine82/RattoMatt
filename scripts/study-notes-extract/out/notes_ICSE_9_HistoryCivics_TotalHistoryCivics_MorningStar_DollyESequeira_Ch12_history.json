But with the passage of time, moral decay crept into some areas in the functioning of the Church. Some of the clergymen lacked proper education and some lived in luxury and neglected their religious duties. The priests promised salvation in exchange for fees. They could pronounce a marriage lawful or unlawful. In fact, there were fees for every transaction in life, from birth to death, fees for the peace of the soul and fees for the souls of the people dead long ago. These practices were severely criticised and opposed by the people. **Desiderius Erasmus**, a Dutch philosopher and humanist exposed them in his book named **'In Praise of Folly'** and prepared the ground for the Reformation."

He got the Church lands and in **1536** passed an **Act for the dissolution of monasteries**, whereby small monasteries with an income of less than £200 a year were closed and their buildings, land and money taken by the Crown. By another Act of **1539**, larger monasteries were closed. The monasteries were a reminder of the power of the Catholic Church. Besides, the monasteries were the wealthiest institutions in the country. King Henry's lavish lifestyle, along with his wars, had led to a lack of money. By destroying the **monastic system**, Henry could acquire all its wealth and property, while at the same time removing the influence of the Pope."

He accused the Church for the sale of indulgences. In **1517**, Luther wrote **Ninety-five theses** or statements dealing with the difference between the beliefs and practices of the Church and nailed them on the church door at Wittenburg. Earlier in **1512**, he undertook a pilgrimage to Rome and found that some of the clergymen were living a luxurious life. This made him a strong opponent of the Church.\n\nThe **Holy Roman Emperor Charles V**, upon request by the Pope, asked Luther to defend his case before a Grand Diet held at Worms known as the **Diet of Worms** consisting of Council of Princes and high dignitaries in **1521**. The Diet ordered that Luther's writings be burnt and Luther be outlawed. But Luther had the support of German rulers, and so no harm was done to him.\n\nThis movement soon came to be described as the **German Protestant Movement**. Luther devoted his time translating the Bible into German and set up an independent church. Luther travelled extensively to different parts of Europe, Germany, Norway, Sweden and Denmark. The Protestant Movement found wide acceptance.\n\n**Lutheranism** was recognised as a legal form of Christianity by a treaty known as **‘The Peace of Augsburg’** in **1555**, nine years after the death of Luther. This treaty was signed between the **Schmalkaldic League** (formed by Luther and some German Princes) and the Roman Catholic Church after a long civil war. In Germany, the Southern states continued to remain loyal to the Catholic Church whereas the Northern states accepted Lutheranism.\n\n[Image: Martin Luther]"
