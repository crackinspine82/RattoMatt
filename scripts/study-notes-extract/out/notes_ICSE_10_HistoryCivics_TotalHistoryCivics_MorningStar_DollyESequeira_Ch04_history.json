The **Partition of Bengal** along with the **Anti-Partition Movement** accelerated the **Nationalist Movement** by spreading it among the general masses. The people rose in unity to resist, to suffer and to sacrifice.\n2.  The ideas of **Swadeshi** and **Boycott**, born of the popular feelings in 1905, took shape and it was realised that Swadeshi and Boycott were complementary and one would not succeed without the other. Swadeshi and Boycott were used as weapons of political agitation and a training in **self-sufficiency** for the attainment of **Swaraj**. British goods were burnt at public places and shops selling them were picketed. The spirit of Swadeshi spread to almost every walk of life—industries, education, culture, literature, etc.\n3.  The **Swadeshi Movement** not only played an important role in the growth of nationalism and patriotism among the masses but it also helped in the **revival of India's traditional and homegrown industries**. This in turn led to an increase in indigenous production and thereby helped in promoting India's economy. When indigenous manufactured products began to be sold in Indian markets, the price of British products dropped. All this helped in the revival of Indian economy.\n4.  A number of indigenous industries like soap and matchstick factories, textile mills, tanneries, banks, insurance companies and so on started growing and pushed the country towards achieving **self-sufficiency** and **self-reliance**.\n5.  The Partition of Bengal left a lasting legacy of **communal distrust and violence**. In fact, the British policy of **Divide and Rule** created a rift between two communities that persisted for decades and ultimately led to the tragic events during the partition of India in 1947.\n6.  The people lost their faith in the fair play and justice of the British. Lord Curzon refused to concede to the demands of annulling the partition. He said, “**Partition of Bengal is a settled fact and what is settled cannot be unsettled.**”\n7.  The Anti-Partition agitation backfired the plans of Lord Curzon. It gave added strength to the **National Movement**. The methods adopted by the Early Nationalists lost their appeal and gave an opportunity to the **Assertive Nationalists** to lead the National Movement.\n\nThe Partition of Bengal was **revoked in 1911**. A new scheme of Partition of Bengal was implemented on linguistic rather than on religious grounds. Hindi, Odiya (Oriya) and Assamese speaking areas were separated from Bengal. Thus, Bihar, Odisha and Assam became separate provinces. The administrative capital of British India was shifted from Kolkata to Delhi in 1911."

Even **Rabindranath Tagore** set up a **Swadeshi Bhandar**.\n6. They declared that what India needed was **total freedom** from foreign rule.\n7.
