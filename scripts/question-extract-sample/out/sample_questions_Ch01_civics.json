Reason (R), however, provides an incorrect justification for the provisions in (A). The text specifies that the Right to Constitutional Remedies was incorporated to ensure Fundamental Rights are not infringed. In contrast, the strong Centre, single citizenship, and judiciary were proposed to 'integrate Indian society', 'maintain territorial integrity and administrative discipline'. Therefore, the reason given in (R) is for a different constitutional feature, making the statement false as an explanation for (A). Hence, (A) is true but (R) is false."

The membership number reduced from 389 to 299 after members representing Pakistan withdrew.\n- **Statement II is incorrect.** The Objectives Resolution was proposed by Pt.

Rajagopalachari was the Governor-General.\nTherefore, only statements I and III are factually accurate according to the provided text."

Option C is correct because Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru proposed the 'Objectives Resolution', which laid down the national goals for the Constitution. Option A is incorrect because Dr. Sinha was the temporary president of the first sitting, he did not propose the resolution. Option B is incorrect as Dr. Prasad was elected President of the Assembly; he did not propose the sitting itself. Option D is incorrect because the Poorna Swaraj Resolution was passed at the Lahore Session of the Congress in 1929, and while Dr. Ambedkar was the architect of the Constitution, he is not associated with proposing this specific resolution."

The logical culmination of this entire reading and drafting process was the completion of the Third and Final Reading on November 26, 1949, when the Constitution was finally passed and adopted. Option A represents an intermediate stage, not the final one. Option C is the enforcement date, a separate event post-adoption. Option D is a preceding event that happened before the readings even began."

This represents a direct parallel in the transformation of function. 'Sovereign Body' was a status acquired during its work, not a new role after its primary task was complete.

The Indian Constitution was adopted on **November 26, 1949**. On this day, 284 members of the Assembly appended their signatures to the document.\n2.  **Enforcement**: This refers to the date when the Constitution came into full effect, and its provisions became legally binding for the governance of the country. The Constitution was enforced on **January 26, 1950**, the day India became a Sovereign Democratic Republic. While most provisions came into force on this day, certain clauses, such as those related to citizenship, were implemented immediately upon adoption.\n\n**Historical Significance of January 26**: This date was specifically chosen for the enforcement of the Constitution because of its historical importance in the freedom struggle. At the Lahore Session of the Congress in December 1929, a resolution declaring 'Poorna Swaraj' (Complete Independence) as the goal was passed. Subsequently, **January 26, 1930**, was celebrated as the first 'Independence Day'. To commemorate this historic event, the founding fathers chose January 26 to formally begin the era of the Indian Republic.",

However, the Muslim League boycotted its proceedings to press for the creation of Pakistan. With the decision to partition the country, the members representing the territories that became Pakistan withdrew from the Assembly. This reduced the membership of the Constituent Assembly of India to 299.\n\n2.  **Transformation into a Sovereign Body**: The Indian Independence Act, 1947, gave legal recognition to the Constituent Assembly. This Act transformed the Assembly from a body created under the proposals of the British government into a fully sovereign entity. As a sovereign body, it was empowered to frame the Constitution for an independent India without any external interference and also functioned as the provisional parliament of the country until the first General Elections.",

Its members were elected indirectly by the Provincial Legislative Assemblies and nominated by the rulers of the Princely States.\n\nIts composition was altered significantly due to the Muslim League's boycott of the Assembly to demand a separate state of Pakistan. Consequently, after the partition of the country, members representing the territories that became Pakistan withdrew. This reduced the Assembly's membership from the original 389 to 299.\n\nIts legal status was transformed by the Indian Independence Act, 1947. This Act gave legal recognition to the Constituent Assembly and established it as a sovereign body, empowering it to function independently and draft the Constitution for a free India without external authority.",

To guarantee the ideal of Fundamental Rights for all citizens, he included a range of civil liberties and, most importantly, the 'Right to Constitutional Remedies' to ensure these rights could be legally enforced against the state.\n3. To achieve the ideal of social and economic democracy, he incorporated the Directive Principles of State Policy, guiding the state to work for the welfare of the people.\n4.

Dr. Rajendra Prasad was elected as the permanent President of the Constituent Assembly on December 11, 1946.\n\n(c) The Constituent Assembly was truly national in character as it gave representation to all shades of public opinion. For example:\n- The Anglo-Indians were represented by Mr. Frank Anthony.\n- The Indian Christians were represented by Dr. H.C. Mukherjee.\n- The Parsees were represented by Dr. H.P. Modi.\n(Other valid examples include Sikhs by Sardar Hukum Singh, or Muslims by Zafar Imam).\n\n(d) The original strength of the Constituent Assembly of undivided India was 389 members. The membership was reduced because the Muslim League boycotted the Assembly to demand Pakistan, and consequently, members representing territories that went to Pakistan withdrew. As a result, the membership of the Constituent Assembly of India stood at 299.",

[3]\n\n(c) Discuss the role and significance of the ‘Objectives Resolution’ in the framing of the Constitution. Who proposed it and what were its main provisions? [4]",
          "model_answer_text": "(a) A 'Constitution' is a comprehensive document containing the set of rules that describe the rights and duties of its citizens and the manner in which the governance of a country is to be carried out. It regulates the powers of the three organs of government and protects citizens from arbitrary decisions. The Constitution of India was adopted on November 26, 1949, and it came into force on January 26, 1950.\n\n(b) The Constituent Assembly's composition initially gave representation to three categories as per the Cabinet Mission plan: the General category, Muslims, and Sikhs. However, Congress leaders ensured that other communities also received representation. These included the Anglo-Indians (represented by Mr. Frank Anthony), Indian Christians (represented by Dr. H.C. Mukherjee), Parsees (represented by Dr. H.P. Modi), Scheduled Castes, and Scheduled Tribes. Even after the Muslim League's boycott, members like Zafar Imam represented the Muslim community. This diverse membership made the Constituent Assembly truly national in character.\n\n(c) The 'Objectives Resolution' was highly significant as it highlighted the objectives of the constitution-makers and laid down the 'national goals' for a free India. It was proposed by Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru on December 13, 1946. Its four main provisions were:\n(i) Free India will be a 'republic'.\n(ii) The ideals of social, political, and economic democracy would be guaranteed to all people.\n(iii) The republic would grant Fundamental Rights to citizens.\n(iv) The state would safeguard the rights of minorities and backward classes.",

          "model_answer_text": "(a) Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, also known as Babasaheb, is regarded as one of the chief architects of the Constitution of India. He was the Chairman of the Drafting Committee. This committee was set up on August 29, 1947, and was entrusted with the primary task of drafting the Constitution.\n\n(b) Dr. B.R. Ambedkar incorporated several key principles to build a strong and unified nation. Three of these are:\n1.  **A strong Centre:** He proposed a strong central government, along with single citizenship and a single judiciary, to maintain the territorial integrity and administrative discipline of the nation.\n2.  **Safeguards for Minorities:** He provided special safeguards for minorities and socially and educationally backward classes, including a system of reservation of jobs in government services.\n3.  **Right to Constitutional Remedies:** He incorporated this right to ensure that the Fundamental Rights of individuals are not infringed upon by the Centre or State governments, thus protecting civil liberties.\n\n(c) The final stages of passing the Constitution involved three 'Readings' of the draft. The draft was discussed clause by clause from November 4, 1948. The third and final reading was completed on November 26, 1949, when the Constitution was adopted. The Constituent Assembly took nearly three years to complete this work. \nThe date January 26 was chosen for its historical significance. At the Lahore Session of Congress in December 1929, a resolution for 'Poorna Swaraj' (Complete Independence) was passed, and January 26, 1930, was celebrated as the first Independence Day. To honour this historic day, January 26 was designated as Republic Day, the day the Constitution came into force.",

[2]\n(b) With reference to the Cabinet Mission's proposal, describe the process of the formation of the Constituent Assembly and the immediate impact of the Muslim League's boycott on its membership. [3]\n(c) Critically analyse the composition of the Constituent Assembly to justify the assertion that it was 'truly national in character', despite the initial representation plan of the Cabinet Mission. Support your answer with specific examples of communities and their representatives. [5]",
          "model_answer_text": "(a) A 'Constitution' is a comprehensive document containing the set of rules that describe the rights and duties of its citizens and the manner according to which the governance of a country is to be carried out. It regulates the powers of the legislative, executive, and judiciary, and moderates the relationship between the government and the governed.\n\n(b) The Constituent Assembly was set up based on a proposal by the Cabinet Mission in 1946. Its members were to be elected indirectly by the Provincial Legislative Assemblies (Lower House only), with Princely States being represented by nominated members. The original strength of the Assembly for undivided India was 389 members. However, the Muslim League boycotted the Assembly, demanding a separate state of Pakistan. Consequently, members representing territories that went to Pakistan withdrew, reducing the Assembly's membership to 299.\n\n(c) The assertion that the Constituent Assembly was 'truly national in character' is justified by its wide-ranging and inclusive membership, which went beyond the three categories (General, Muslims, Sikhs) initially envisioned by the Cabinet Mission plan. The Congress leaders ensured that other communities were represented:\n- The Anglo-Indians were represented by Mr. Frank Anthony and Mr. S.H. Prater.\n- The Indian Christians were represented by Dr. H.C. Mukherjee and Joseph D'souza.\n- The Parsees were represented by Dr. H.P. Modi.\n- Even after the Muslim League's boycott, the Muslim community was still represented by members like Zafar Imam and Mohammad Saadullah.\n- The Sikhs were represented by Sardar Hukum Singh and Ujjal Singh.\n- The inclusion of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes also contributed to its representative nature. This diverse composition, reflecting all shades of public opinion, validates its national character.",

          "model_answer_text": "(a) The Drafting Committee, set up on August 29, 1947, was entrusted with the specific task of drafting the Constitution. Its Chairman was Dr. B.R. Ambedkar.\n\n(b) The 'Objectives Resolution', proposed by Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru on December 13, 1946, was significant as it highlighted the objectives of the Constituent Assembly and laid down the 'national goals' that would guide the framing of the Constitution. The four main goals were:\n(i) India will be a 'republic'.\n(ii) Ideals of social, political and economic democracy would be guaranteed to all.\n(iii) The republic would grant Fundamental Rights to citizens.\n(iv) The state would safeguard the rights of minorities and backward classes.\n\n(c) Dr. B.R. Ambedkar's contribution was pivotal. Three key principles he incorporated were:\n1. He provided special safeguards for minorities and socially/educationally backward classes, including a system of reservation.\n2. He incorporated the Right to Constitutional Remedies to ensure Fundamental Rights are not infringed upon.\n3. He promoted national unity through single citizenship, a single judiciary, and a strong Centre to maintain territorial integrity and administrative discipline.\n(Any three of the five points from the text would be valid).\n\nThe Constitution was adopted and passed by the Constituent Assembly on November 26, 1949. However, it came into force (enforcement) on January 26, 1950. The date January 26th was chosen for its historical significance. It commemorates the Lahore Session of the Congress in December 1929, where a resolution for 'Poorna Swaraj' (Complete Independence) was passed. Following this, January 26, 1930, was celebrated as the first 'Independence Day', and this tradition continued until 1947.",

[3 marks]\n(c) Trace the key procedural milestones of the Constituent Assembly from the proposal of the 'Objectives Resolution' to the final adoption of the Constitution. [4 marks]",
          "model_answer_text": "(a) The Cabinet Mission arrived in India in 1946 and put forward a proposal to set up a Constituent Assembly. Its key role was to provide the framework for this body, whose members were to be elected indirectly by the Provincial Legislative Assemblies (Lower House only). The initial composition of the Constituent Assembly of undivided India consisted of 389 members. This comprised 292 elected members from the provinces, 93 members nominated by the rulers of the Princely States, three from Chief Commissioner Provinces, and one from the British.\n\n(b) The Muslim League boycotted the Constituent Assembly to press their demand for a separate state of Pakistan. Following the Indian Independence Act, 1947, which created Pakistan, the members representing the territories that went to Pakistan withdrew from the Assembly. This caused the membership to be reduced to 299. The reconstituted Assembly was truly national and diverse in character. Beyond the categories of General, Muslim, and Sikh, Congress leaders ensured representation for other communities. For example, the Anglo-Indians were represented by Mr. Frank Anthony, Indian Christians by Dr. H.C. Mukherjee, Parsees by Dr. H.P. Modi, and Sikhs by Sardar Hukum Singh. Representation was also given to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.\n\n(c) The key procedural milestones were as follows:\n1.  **Objectives Resolution:** On December 13, 1946, Jawaharlal Nehru proposed the 'Objectives Resolution', which laid down the national goals, such as India being a republic and guaranteeing fundamental rights. It was passed on January 22, 1947.\n2.  **Formation of Drafting Committee:** On August 29, 1947, the Assembly set up the Drafting Committee under the Chairmanship of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar to prepare a draft of the Constitution.\n3.  **Readings of the Draft:** The draft was discussed clause by clause. The First Reading began on November 4, 1948. The Second Reading was completed on October 17, 1949. The Third and final Reading was completed on November 26, 1949.\n4.  **Adoption of the Constitution:** After the three readings and detailed discussions, the Constitution was finally passed and adopted by the Constituent Assembly on November 26, 1949.",

[3 marks]\n(b) State the date of adoption and the date of enforcement of the Indian Constitution. Explain the historical significance of the date chosen for its enforcement. [3 marks]\n(c) Analyse the pivotal contribution of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar to the Indian Constitution by describing four principles he incorporated to create a unified and equitable nation. [4 marks]",
          "model_answer_text": "(a) A 'Constitution' is a comprehensive document containing the set of rules that describe the rights and duties of its citizens and the manner in which the governance of a country is to be carried out. \nA constitutional or democratic government is distinguished from an absolute monarchy or dictatorship because a constitution moderates relations between the government and the governed. It protects the interests of citizens by restraining the government from taking arbitrary decisions. In contrast, an absolute monarchy is not bound by such a document, and power is concentrated without formal checks or protection of citizen rights.\n\n(b) The Indian Constitution was adopted and passed on **November 26, 1949**. It came into force (enforcement) on **January 26, 1950**. \nThe date January 26 was chosen for its historical significance. The Indian National Congress, at its Lahore Session in December 1929, passed the 'Poorna Swaraj' or Complete Independence resolution. It was decided to celebrate January 26, 1930, as the first 'Independence Day'. To commemorate this historic event, January 26 was chosen as the day the Indian Republic would be born, and it is now celebrated as Republic Day.\n\n(c) Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, as the Chairman of the Drafting Committee, was an architect of the Constitution. Four key principles he incorporated are:\n1.  **Workable and Flexible Constitution:** He ensured the Constitution was strong enough to hold the country together in both peace and war, while also being flexible enough to be amended over time.\n2.  **Safeguards for Minorities and Backward Classes:** He incorporated provisions for constitutional guarantees and protections for minorities, along with special safeguards like reservation of jobs in government services for members of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.\n3.  **Right to Constitutional Remedies:** To make Fundamental Rights effective, he included the Right to Constitutional Remedies, which empowers citizens to approach the judiciary if their rights are infringed by the state.\n4.  **A Strong Centre with a Single Polity:** To ensure national integrity and administrative discipline, he provided for a single citizenship, a single integrated judiciary, and uniformity in fundamental laws, advocating for a strong Centre.",

After the Indian Independence Act, 1947, the Muslim League boycotted the Assembly, and members representing territories that went to Pakistan withdrew. As a result, the membership of the Constituent Assembly of India was reduced from the original 389 to 299.\n\n(c) The Constitution was adopted on November 26, 1949. It was enforced on January 26, 1950. The date January 26 was chosen for its historical significance. It commemorates the Lahore Session of the Congress in December 1929, where a resolution for 'Poorna Swaraj' (Complete Independence) was passed. Following this, January 26, 1930, was celebrated as the first Independence Day. To honour this historic day, it was designated as Republic Day, the day India officially became a Sovereign Democratic Republic.",

[2]\n\n(b) The Constituent Assembly underwent a significant change in its legal status and function after the Indian Independence Act, 1947, and again after the Constitution came into force. Differentiate between the role of the Constituent Assembly as a constitution-making body and its role as the 'provisional parliament'. [3]\n\n(c) The process of creating the Constitution was meticulous. Trace the key procedural milestones from the establishment of the Drafting Committee to the final adoption of the Constitution. Further, explain the historical significance of choosing January 26 for the Constitution's enforcement, rather than the date of its adoption. [5]",
          "model_answer_text": "(a) The person in the picture is Dr. Rajendra Prasad. His primary role was as the President of the Constituent Assembly, elected on December 11, 1946.\n\n(b) As a constitution-making body, the Constituent Assembly's primary function, from its first session on December 9, 1946, was to draft and enact the Constitution of India. It became a sovereign body after the Indian Independence Act, 1947. As the 'provisional parliament', its role began after the Constitution came into force on January 26, 1950. In this capacity, its function shifted from drafting the constitution to exercising legislative power and governing the country until the first General Elections were held in 1951–52.\n\n(c) Procedural Milestones: The Drafting Committee was set up on August 29, 1947. The Draft Constitution was discussed clause by clause in the First Reading starting November 4, 1948. The Second Reading was completed on October 17, 1949. The Third and final Reading was completed on November 26, 1949, which is also the date the Constitution was passed and adopted by the Assembly. \nHistorical Significance of January 26: While the Constitution was adopted on November 26, 1949, the date January 26 was chosen for its enforcement due to its historical importance. The Lahore Session of the Congress in December 1929 had passed the 'Poorna Swaraj' (Complete Independence) resolution. Subsequently, January 26, 1930, was celebrated as the first 'Independence Day'. To honour this significant date in the freedom struggle, January 26 was selected as the day India would formally become a Republic.",

With reference to the principles he incorporated, analyse how he reconciled the need for a 'strong Centre' with the objective of safeguarding 'civil liberties' for individual citizens. [3]\n\n(c) The Constituent Assembly, though its members were indirectly elected, is described as 'truly national in character'. Justify this statement by citing specific examples of diverse community representation. Contrast the initial representation plan proposed by the Cabinet Mission with the more inclusive composition that was finally achieved. [5]",
          "model_answer_text": "(a) The person is Dr. B.R. Ambedkar. He was the Chairman of the Drafting Committee. The committee's primary mandate was the task of drafting the Constitution.\n\n(b) Dr. Ambedkar reconciled the need for a strong Centre with safeguarding individual civil liberties through a balanced constitutional framework. To create a strong Centre for maintaining national integrity and administrative discipline, he incorporated provisions like a single citizenship and a single judiciary. Simultaneously, to protect civil liberties, he provided for constitutional guarantees, most notably the Fundamental Rights. The 'Right to Constitutional Remedies' was included as a crucial tool to ensure these rights were not infringed upon by the Centre or State governments, thus balancing state power with individual freedom.\n\n(c) Justification: The Constituent Assembly was 'truly national in character' because the Congress leaders ensured that it went beyond the initial plan to include a wide spectrum of communities. For instance, the Anglo-Indians were represented by Mr. Frank Anthony, Indian Christians by Dr. H.C. Mukherjee, Parsees by Dr. H.P. Modi, and Sikhs by Sardar Hukum Singh. Representation was also given to Scheduled Castes and Tribes. Even after the Muslim League's boycott, the Muslim community was represented by members like Zafar Imam.\nContrast: The initial Cabinet Mission plan was narrower in scope, ensuring representation for only three categories: the General category, Muslims, and Sikhs. The final composition was far more inclusive, deliberately incorporating representatives from various other minority communities, thereby giving the Assembly its truly national and diverse character.",

State the date on which this event occurred. [2]\n\n(b) The individual identified was the President of the Constituent Assembly. Describe the final composition of this Assembly after the partition of India, and explain how, despite the Cabinet Mission's initial plan, it became 'truly national in character'. [3]\n\n(c) The document signed in the picture was enforced on a different date from when it was adopted. Differentiate between the 'date of adoption' and the 'date of enforcement' of the Constitution. Further, elaborate on the historical significance of selecting January 26 for the Constitution's commencement. [5]",
          "model_answer_text": "(a) The person in the photograph is Dr. Rajendra Prasad. The event depicted is the signing of the Constitution of India, which marked its adoption and passing by the Constituent Assembly. This event occurred on November 26, 1949.\n\n(b) After the withdrawal of the Muslim League members representing territories that went to Pakistan, the membership of the Constituent Assembly of India stood at 299 against the original 389. The Assembly became 'truly national in character' because while the Cabinet Mission plan had only ensured representation for the General category, Muslims, and Sikhs, the Congress leaders ensured that other communities like Anglo-Indians (represented by Mr. Frank Anthony), Indian Christians (represented by Dr. H.C. Mukherjee), Parsees, Scheduled Castes, and Scheduled Tribes also received representation.\n\n(c) The 'date of adoption' is November 26, 1949, the day the Constituent Assembly passed and adopted the final draft of the Constitution. The 'date of enforcement' is January 26, 1950, the day the Constitution as a whole came into force, and India became a Sovereign Democratic Republic. The date January 26 was chosen for its historical significance. At the Lahore Session of the Congress in December 1929, a resolution for 'Poorna Swaraj' (Complete Independence) was passed. Consequently, January 26, 1930, was celebrated as the first 'Independence Day'. To honour this historic day, the founding fathers chose January 26 for the commencement of the Constitution, designating it as Republic Day.",

It acts as a constitutional guarantee, allowing citizens to approach the judiciary if their fundamental rights are infringed upon by the Centre or State governments, thus protecting individual liberty.\n3.  **Directive Principles of State Policy:** These principles were incorporated to guide the state in making laws and policies.

This legal sanction enabled the Constituent Assembly to function after India's independence. The Assembly became a sovereign body. To carry on its work it appointed eight committees. The Drafting Committee, under the Chairmanship of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar was set up on August 29, 1947 and was entrusted with the task of drafting the Constitution.\n\nDr. Bhimrao Ambedkar, popularly known as Babasaheb, was one of the architects of the Constitution of India. The text of the Constitution prepared by Babasaheb provided for constitutional guarantees and protections for a wide range of civil liberties for individual citizens, including freedom of religion, the abolition of untouchability, social rights for women and a system of reservation of jobs in the government services for members of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.\n\n(a) Name the committee that was entrusted with the task of drafting the Constitution.

The proposal for this body came from the Cabinet Mission in 1946. Initially, the Constituent Assembly of undivided India consisted of 389 members. However, following the partition of the country, the Muslim League, which had boycotted the Assembly, withdrew its members. Consequently, the membership of the Constituent Assembly of India was reduced to 299. Despite this, the Congress leaders ensured that the Assembly was truly national in character, giving representation to all shades of public opinion. Various communities like the Anglo-Indians, represented by Mr. Frank Anthony; the Indian Christians, represented by Dr. H.C. Mukherjee; the Parsees by Dr. H.P. Modi; and the Sikhs by Sardar Hukum Singh, were included. The first sitting of the Assembly was held on December 9, 1946, with Dr. Rajendra Prasad later being elected as its permanent President.\n\n(a) Name the British mission that proposed the setting up of the Constituent Assembly. [1]\n(b) Explain why the membership of the Constituent Assembly was reduced from 389 to 299. [2]\n(c) Justify the statement that the 'Constituent Assembly was truly national in character' by citing three examples of community representation mentioned in the passage. [3]",

Following the partition of India, the members representing the territories which went to Pakistan withdrew from the Constituent Assembly of India.\n\n(c) The statement is justified because the Assembly provided representation to various communities, ensuring it reflected the diversity of the nation. Three examples are:\n1. The Anglo-Indians were represented by Mr. Frank Anthony.\n2. The Indian Christians were represented by Dr. H.C. Mukherjee.\n3. The Sikhs were represented by Sardar Hukum Singh. (or The Parsees were represented by Dr. H.P. Modi).",

To facilitate its work, it appointed various committees. The most significant of these was the Drafting Committee, set up on August 29, 1947, under the chairmanship of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar. This committee was entrusted with the task of preparing a draft of the Constitution. The draft was discussed clause by clause in the Assembly and went through three readings. The third and final reading was completed on November 26, 1949, the day the Constitution was adopted and passed. However, the Constitution as a whole came into force on January 26, 1950. This date was specially selected because of its historical importance, as it commemorated the declaration of 'Poorna Swaraj' (Complete Independence) at the Lahore Session of the Congress in 1929, and the celebration of the first Independence Day on January 26, 1930. On this day, India became a Sovereign Democratic Republic.\n\n(a) Who was the Chairman of the Drafting Committee? State the primary task entrusted to this committee.

          "question_text": "Read the following passage and answer the questions that follow.\n\n_The first sitting of the Constituent Assembly was held on December 9, 1946. It was presided over by Dr. Sachidananda Sinha. On December 11, 1946, Dr. Rajendra Prasad was elected President of the Constituent Assembly. The Indian Independence Act, 1947, recognised the existence of the Constituent Assembly of India. This legal sanction enabled the Constituent Assembly to function after India's independence. The Assembly became a sovereign body. To carry on its work it appointed eight committees. The Drafting Committee, under the Chairmanship of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar was set up on August 29, 1947 and was entrusted with the task of drafting the Constitution. The Draft was discussed by the Constituent Assembly, clause by clause... It was followed by the third and the final Reading which were completed on November 26, 1949. The Constitution was adopted and passed on this day._\n\n(a) Distinguish between the constitutional roles and composition of the Constituent Assembly and the Drafting Committee. [3]\n\n(b) Explain the significance of the dates November 26, 1949 and January 26, 1950 in the context of the Constitution's implementation. Why was the latter date specifically chosen for enforcement? [4]\n\n(c) The Constituent Assembly became a 'sovereign body' and also acted as the 'provisional parliament'. Explain the implications of these two roles. [3]",
          "model_answer_text": "(a) \n**Constituent Assembly:**\n*   **Role:** It was the supreme, sovereign body responsible for debating, deliberating upon, and ultimately adopting the Constitution of India. It appointed various committees, including the Drafting Committee, to facilitate its work.\n*   **Composition:** It was a large body, initially with 389 members (later 299 after partition), representing various communities and regions, elected indirectly by Provincial Legislative Assemblies and nominated by Princely States.\n\n**Drafting Committee:**\n*   **Role:** It was a specialized sub-committee of the Constituent Assembly. Its specific task was to prepare the draft of the Constitution based on the Assembly's discussions and decisions.\n*   **Composition:** It was a smaller body of eight members, with Dr. B.R. Ambedkar as its Chairman.\n\n(b) \n*   **November 26, 1949:** This is the date when the Constitution was finally passed and adopted by the Constituent Assembly after the completion of the third reading. This date signifies the completion of the constitution-making process. Some provisions, like those on citizenship, came into force immediately.\n*   **January 26, 1950:** This is the date when the Constitution as a whole came into force (commencement). On this day, India became a Sovereign Democratic Republic. \n*   **Reason for choice:** This date was chosen for its historical importance. It commemorated the Lahore Session of the Congress (December 1929) where the resolution for 'Poorna Swaraj' (Complete Independence) was passed, and January 26, 1930, was celebrated as the first Independence Day. To honour this historic day, it was designated as Republic Day.\n\n(c)\n*   **Sovereign Body:** As a 'sovereign body', the Constituent Assembly was no longer subject to the authority of the British Parliament after the Indian Independence Act, 1947. It had the supreme and independent authority to frame the Constitution for India as it saw fit, without any external interference.\n*   **Provisional Parliament:** In its role as the 'provisional parliament', the Assembly performed the legislative functions for the country from August 15, 1947, until the first General Elections were held in 1951-52. This included making ordinary laws for the governance of the country, thereby filling the legislative vacuum during the transition period.",

Jawaharlal Nehru proposed the 'Objectives Resolution' on December 13, 1946. The 'Resolution' highlighted the objectives and laid down the 'national goals'. The ideals of social, political and economic democracy would be guaranteed to all people. The republic would grant Fundamental Rights to citizens. The state would safeguard the rights of minorities and backward classes. The 'Objectives Resolution' was passed by the Constituent Assembly on January 22, 1947. Dr. B.R. Ambedkar incorporated the Right to Constitutional Remedies to ensure that the Fundamental Rights of the individuals are not infringed... [and] Provided special safeguards to the minorities and certain classes, who are socially and educationally backward._\n\n(a) Who proposed the 'Objectives Resolution' and on what date? State two of its key objectives mentioned in the passage. [3]\n\n(b) Analyse the contribution of Dr. B. R. Ambedkar in translating two ideals of the 'Objectives Resolution' into specific constitutional provisions, as mentioned in the passage. [4]\n\n(c) The chapter states that the Constitution aims to distinguish a 'constitutional government' from an 'absolute monarchy'. Based on the passage, explain how the principles of the 'Objectives Resolution' achieve this distinction. [3]",
          "model_answer_text": "(a)\n*   **Proposer and Date:** Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru proposed the 'Objectives Resolution' on December 13, 1946.\n*   **Two Key Objectives:**\n    1.  To guarantee social, political and economic democracy to all people.\n    2.  To grant Fundamental Rights to citizens. (Any two from the four mentioned in the source can be cited).\n\n(b) \nDr. Ambedkar played a crucial role in giving practical shape to the ideals of the 'Objectives Resolution'.\n1.  **Ideal of 'Fundamental Rights':** The Resolution's goal to 'grant Fundamental Rights to citizens' was made effective by Dr. Ambedkar's incorporation of the 'Right to Constitutional Remedies'. This provision is vital because it provides a mechanism for citizens to approach the judiciary if their Fundamental Rights are infringed upon by the state, thus making the rights enforceable and not just theoretical.\n2.  **Ideal of 'Safeguarding Minorities':** The Resolution's objective to 'safeguard the rights of minorities and backward classes' was directly implemented through the provisions for 'special safeguards' that Dr. Ambedkar included. This translated into concrete measures like the system of reservation of jobs in government services for members of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, ensuring their protection and representation.\n\n(c)\nThe principles of the 'Objectives Resolution' fundamentally distinguish a constitutional government from an absolute monarchy in the following ways:\n1.  **Source of Power:** By aiming for a 'republic' with 'social, political and economic democracy', the Resolution places sovereignty with the people, who elect their government. This is in direct contrast to an absolute monarchy, where a hereditary ruler holds absolute power.\n2.  **Limits on State Power:** The guarantee of 'Fundamental Rights' and the commitment to 'safeguard the rights of minorities' act as a check on the government's authority. A constitutional government is one with limited powers, restrained by the constitution from taking arbitrary decisions against its citizens. An absolute monarch, by definition, faces no such legal or constitutional restraints.",

          "model_answer_text": "Initially, the Constituent Assembly was not a sovereign body because it was formed based on the proposals of the British Cabinet Mission in 1946. Its authority and framework were derived from and limited by the British government's plan.\n\nThe legal instrument that transformed its status was the Indian Independence Act, 1947, which recognised the Assembly as a sovereign body.\n\nTwo significant consequences of this transformation were:\n1.  **Change in Membership:** Following the creation of Pakistan by the Act, members representing territories that joined Pakistan withdrew from the Assembly. This directly caused the membership to decrease from the original 389 to 299.\n2.  **Expansion of Powers:** As a sovereign body, the Assembly was freed from the constraints of the Cabinet Mission plan. It gained the supreme legal power to draft the Constitution for an independent India and also began functioning as the provisional parliament for the new nation until the first General Elections.",

          "model_answer_text": "(a) The Indian Independence Act, 1947, fundamentally altered the legal status of the Constituent Assembly. The text states that the Act provided \"legal sanction\" which enabled the Assembly to function after independence. This transformed it into a \"sovereign body,\" meaning it was no longer under the authority of any external power, like the British Parliament, and had the absolute authority to draft and enact a constitution for a free India.\n\n(b) The claim that the Assembly was not 'truly representative' before August 1947 is largely inaccurate. The text highlights that from its inception, the Assembly \"gave representation to all shades of public opinion.\" While the Cabinet Mission Plan specified representation for the General, Muslim, and Sikh categories, Congress leaders ensured other communities like Anglo-Indians (Mr. Frank Anthony), Indian Christians (Dr. H.C. Mukherjee), Parsees (Dr. H.P. Modi), Scheduled Castes, and Scheduled Tribes were included. The text explicitly concludes that the Assembly was \"truly national in character\" even before independence and partition. The boycott by the Muslim League reduced one community's representation but did not negate the diverse and national character of the body as a whole.\n\n(c) The statement is only partially accurate. It is correct that the Assembly became a 'sovereign body' only as a result of the Indian Independence Act, 1947. However, it is incorrect to claim that it only became 'truly representative' at that point. Its representative character was a feature from its formation in 1946, established through a wide-ranging membership that reflected India's diversity. Therefore, the Act conferred sovereignty upon an already representative body, it did not create its representative nature.",

The state would safeguard the rights of minorities and backward classes.\n\n(b) \n1. To implement the goal of granting **Fundamental Rights**, Dr. Ambedkar's most significant contribution was the incorporation of the **'Right to Constitutional Remedies'**. This provision acted as a practical mechanism by making the Fundamental Rights legally enforceable. It empowered citizens to approach the judiciary if their rights were violated, thus transforming the rights from mere ideals into guaranteed civil liberties.\n2. To achieve the objective of safeguarding the rights of **minorities and backward classes**, Dr. Ambedkar incorporated **'special safeguards'**. The text specifies a \"system of reservation of jobs\" for Scheduled Castes and Tribes and protections for those \"socially and educationally backward\". These specific, affirmative policies were the direct, practical application of the Resolution's abstract goal to protect vulnerable communities.\n\n(c) The Objectives Resolution and the Drafting Committee played distinct but complementary roles. The Resolution served as the philosophical blueprint or the 'guiding principles', outlining the aspirational vision and core values for the new nation (e.g., democracy, justice, rights). The Drafting Committee, led by Dr. Ambedkar, performed the critical architectural and engineering role. It translated these abstract ideals into a concrete, legally binding, and workable document—the Constitution. It created the specific structures (strong Centre, single judiciary) and enforceable provisions (Fundamental Rights, Directive Principles) required to bring the vision to life. In essence, the Resolution provided the soul, while the Drafting Committee provided the body of the Constitution.",
