        "content_md": "Geodesy is the science of accurately measuring and understanding three fundamental properties of the Earth: its geometric shape, its orientation in space, and its gravity field— as well as the changes of these properties with time. By using GPS, geodesists monitor the movement of a site continuously (24×7).\n\nGeodesy is used to map shorelines, determine land boundaries, and improve transportation and navigation safety. To measure points on the Earth's surface, geodesists assign coordinates using space-based tools like the Global Positioning System (GPS) to points all over the Earth.\n\nTo measure the Earth, geodesists have adopted the ellipsoid as the most basic model of the Earth. But the ellipsoid is based on a very simple mathematical model, it assumes the earth's surface is smooth like the oceanic surface and does not include any mountains or valleys. When additional detail of the Earth is needed, geodesists use the geoid — a shape that exists over the whole globe."

Atmospheric **carbon dioxide** is used by plants in the presence of sunlight and chlorophyll to make their own food by the process of **photosynthesis**. During this process CO₂ is fixed as starch by plants. From the plants, **carbon** moves along the **food chain** through **consumers** at different levels. After the death of plants and animals, the **carbon** present in their bodies is decomposed and absorbed as food by saprophytic bacteria and fungi. When plants die and get buried in the soil, they undergo slow degradation and compaction. This results in the formation of **fossil fuels** containing huge amounts of **carbon**.\n\n[Image: Fig. 1.11. Carbon Cycle]\n\nDuring **respiration**, plants, animals and humans, use atmospheric oxygen and release **carbon dioxide** back into the atmosphere. The burning of carbon containing fuels also results in the release of CO₂ in the atmosphere.\n\nThus, **carbon** from CO₂ taken by green plants from the environment through **photosynthesis** is returned to the environment through **respiration**, decomposition and through burning of fuels.\n\nThis cyclic movement of **carbon** from the atmosphere to the organisms and from organisms to the atmosphere is known as **carbon cycle**. The **carbon cycle** helps in maintaining **carbon** balance in nature.\n\nAny imbalance of **carbon** in the atmosphere heats up the earth and leads to **Global Warming**. Excessive use of gases that produce undue heat and global warming has to be avoided to maintain a healthy atmosphere."

By using GPS, geodesists monitor the movement of a site continuously (24×7).\n\nGeodesy is used to map shorelines, determine land boundaries, and improve transportation and navigation safety. To measure points on the Earth's surface, geodesists assign coordinates using space-based tools like the Global Positioning System (GPS) to points all over the Earth.\n\nTo measure the Earth, geodesists have adopted the ellipsoid as the most basic model of the Earth. But the ellipsoid is based on a very simple mathematical model, it assumes the earth's surface is smooth like the oceanic surface and does not include any mountains or valleys. When additional detail of the Earth is needed, geodesists use the geoid — a shape that exists over the whole globe."
