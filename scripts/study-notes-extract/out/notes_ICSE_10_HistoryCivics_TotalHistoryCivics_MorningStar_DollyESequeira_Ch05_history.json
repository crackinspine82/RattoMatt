The Congress cooperated with them and the Khilafat issue was included as one of the demands of the Non-cooperation Movement. As a result, a pact which is known as the Lucknow Pact was signed. The Lucknow Pact refers to the joint scheme of political reforms agreed to by both the Congress and the Muslim League in 1916 regarding the structure of government in India and the relationship between the Hindus and the Muslims. According to this Pact, the Congress accepted the concept of communal electorate which subsequently added to the communal bitterness."

The communal riots broke out in the country and in 1947, a separate country, Pakistan, came into existence."

Some **British and communal historians** divided Indian history into the **Hindu and the Muslim periods**. The rule of **Turks, Afghans and Mughals** was called the **Muslim rule**, where the rulers were said to be the followers of Islam and their subjects, the followers of other religions. In the so-called **Hindu period**, Muslim rulers were dubbed as foreign invaders who had settled in India.\n2.  The **British and communal historians** ignored the notion of a **composite culture** in India and tried to create a rift between the two communities. They failed to interpret that the diversity was primarily class-wise and region-wise and not religion-wise.\n3.  Some communal historians highlighted the myth that Indian society and culture had reached great heights during the **ancient period** but was declining during the **medieval period** which was dominated by Mughal rulers. They did not give much importance to the contribution of the medieval period to the development of Indian economy, religion, art, literature, culture and society.\n4.  The **communal bias** was propagated through poetry, drama, novels, short stories, newspapers, etc.\n\nIn the words of Mahatma Gandhi, \"Communal harmony could not be permanently established in our country so long as highly distorted versions of history were taught in her schools.\""

The Congress cooperated with them and the Khilafat issue was included as one of the demands of the Non-cooperation Movement. As a result, a pact which is known as the Lucknow Pact was signed. The Lucknow Pact refers to the joint scheme of political reforms agreed to by both the Congress and the Muslim League in 1916 regarding the structure of government in India and the relationship between the Hindus and the Muslims. According to this Pact, the Congress accepted the concept of communal electorate which subsequently added to the communal bitterness."
