They made the following demands:\n\n1.  **Abolition of India Council**.\n2.  **Expansion of the Legislative Council** and **Legislative Assemblies**—both at the Centre and in the Provinces.\n3.  **Increase in the membership of Indians** by including some members elected by local bodies like Chambers of Commerce, Universities, etc., in these Councils and by giving greater powers to them. They demanded Indian control over the public purse and raised the slogan **'No taxation without representation'**.\n4.  By the beginning of the 20th century, they made a demand for **Swarajya** or **self-government** within the British empire like the self-governing colonies of Canada and Australia.\n5.  Adequate representation of Indians in the **Executive Council of the Viceroy** and those of the Governors."

The **Early Nationalists** did pioneering work by exposing the true nature of the British rule in India. They made people realise the economic content and character of **British imperialism**. By doing so, they weakened the foundations of the British rule in India.\n4. Their political and economic programmes established the truth that India must be ruled in the interest of the Indians.\n5. The efforts of the **Early Nationalists** led to the following reforms:\n   (i) The appointment of a **Public Service Commission** in 1886;\n   (ii) A resolution of the **House of Commons (1893)** for simultaneous examination for the **I.C.S. in London and India**;\n   (iii) Appointment of the **Welby Commission on Indian Expenditure (1895)**;\n   (iv) the **Indian Councils Act of 1892**.\n\nThese achievements of the Early Nationalists served as a base for the national movement in later years."

In fact, a few government officials attended the first session of the Congress and took part in its deliberations. The Congress members were invited to a garden party by the Viceroy, **Lord Dufferin** in **Kolkata (1886)**. But the official attitude soon changed. Lord Dufferin, tried to divert the National Movement by suggesting to Hume that the Congress should devote itself to social rather than political affairs. However, instead of being a tool in the hands of the authorities, the Congress gradually became the focus of **Indian nationalism**.\n\nIn **1887**, **Lord Dufferin** attacked the National Congress in his speech and ridiculed it as representing only **'a microscopic minority of the people'**. British officials criticised the National Congress and branded its leaders as **'disloyal babus'** and **'violent villains'**.\n\nIn **1890**, the Government employees were forbidden from participating in the Congress deliberations or attending its meetings. Realising that the growing unity of the Indians posed a major threat to their rule, the British pushed further the policy of **'divide and rule'**. They encouraged **Sir Sayyid Ahmad Khan**, **Raja Shiva Prasad of Benaras (Varanasi)**, and other pro-British individuals to start an **anti-Congress movement**. They sowed seeds of communalism between the Hindus and the Muslims on the one hand and between the Indian masses and their leaders on the other. They followed a policy of granting minor concessions to put down the growth of nationalism. However, their policy of repression and hostility made the Congress more powerful."
