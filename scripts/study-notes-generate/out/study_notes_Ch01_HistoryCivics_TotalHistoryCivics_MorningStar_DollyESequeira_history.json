This period is known as the **Chalcolithic Period**.\n\nLater, the art of mixing copper with tin or zinc was discovered to produce the alloy **bronze**. Bronze is harder and more ductile than copper, making it more suitable for tools and weapons. Due to its importance, the first civilisations are known as the **Bronze Age Civilisations**.\n\nBy about 2500 BC, four Bronze Age civilisations had emerged:\n1.  **The Harappan Civilisation** in northern and western parts of India and Pakistan.\n2.  **The Mesopotamian Civilisation** on the banks of the Euphrates and Tigris rivers in modern Iraq.\n3.  **The Chinese Civilisation** in the valley of the Hwang Ho and Yangtze rivers.\n4.  **The Egyptian Civilisation** on the banks of the Nile river in Egypt."

It is a large rectangular tank in a courtyard surrounded by a corridor.\n\n**Features:**\n*   Two flights of steps, one in the north and one in the south, lead into the tank.\n*   To make it watertight, it was constructed with burnt bricks and mortar lined with **bitumen** and **gypsum**.\n*   Water was supplied by a well in an adjacent room.\n*   Surrounding the bath were porticos, sets of rooms, and a stairway to an upper storey. It is believed these rooms were for priests or for changing clothes.\n*   Its features suggest it was used for **ritual bathing**.\n\n**Information provided by the Great Bath:**\n*   The art of building had reached a high degree of perfection.\n*   Its massive structure indicates the existence of a **ruling class** capable of mobilizing labour and collecting taxes for public works.\n*   The design shows efficient planning for water supply and sewage disposal.\n*   It suggests the importance of ceremonial bathing in religious life, a tradition that continues in India.\n*   The use of standardised sun-dried or baked bricks indicates significant planning."

About 2,000 seals have been discovered, mostly made of terracotta, steatite, and agate. Most are rectangular or square, though some are circular. They feature short inscriptions and pictures of animals like the one-horned bull, buffalo, tiger, goat, elephant, and rhinoceros.\n\n**Information provided by Seals:**\n*   **Religion:** The **Pashupati Seal**, showing a three-faced deity in a yogic posture surrounded by animals (elephant, tiger, buffalo, rhinoceros, with two deer at his feet), suggests the worship of a deity identified as **Pashupati Mahadeva** (Shiva).\n*   **Beliefs:** The **unicorn seal** depicts mythical beliefs.\n*   **Script:** The seals contain a script that has not yet been deciphered.\n*   **Trade:** Seals were used for commercial purposes. Traders stamped their goods by pressing the seal onto wet clay on the knot of a bag. An intact seal on arrival indicated the goods were not tampered with and identified the sender. The discovery of seals in different regions shows that Harappan trade was widespread.\n*   **Amulets:** Seals were probably also used as amulets, carried by their owners."

It was made of baked bricks and surrounded by a massive brick wall for flood protection. It was connected by channels to the Gulf of Cambay.\n\nThe discovery of stone anchors, marine shells, and seals traceable to the Persian Gulf strongly suggests that Lothal was a major port and a centre for trade and manufacturing.\n\n**Information provided by the Dockyard:**\n*   It indicates the existence of extensive **internal and external trade**.\n*   It testifies to the **hydraulic knowledge** of the Harappans, who designed it to handle tides for docking ships."

The script is found on seals, copper tools, jar rims, tablets, and jewellery.\n\n**Information provided by the Script:**\n*   It was **not alphabetical** due to the large number of signs.\n*   It was written from **right to left**, as evident from seals where the engraver ran out of space on the left side.\n*   Its presence on a wide variety of objects suggests that many people were likely literate."

Bead-making was also a developed art.\n*   **Pottery:** Harappans produced glossy, shining pottery on the potter's wheel, often decorated with black geometrical designs.\n*   **Sculpture:** Artists were skilled in creating highly realistic human and animal figures with detailed anatomical features.
