The **Bijak** is preserved by the **Kabirpanthis** (followers of Kabir) in Varanasi and Uttar Pradesh.\n\n**Kabir's Teachings According to Bijak:**\n*   **One God:** There is only one God, who may be worshipped under many names.\n*   **Means of Salvation:** Devotion to God and good actions are the only paths to salvation.\n*   **Purity:** One must be free from dishonesty, insincerity, and hypocrisy to reach God.\n*   **Equality:** All men are equal before God; there are no caste distinctions or supremacy of the priestly class.\n*   **Denunciation of Rituals:** He condemned idol worship, empty rituals, meaningless ceremonies, and pilgrimages.\n\nBijak presents Kabir's compositions in a simple style, urging listeners to abandon delusions and orthodox views for a direct experience of truth."
