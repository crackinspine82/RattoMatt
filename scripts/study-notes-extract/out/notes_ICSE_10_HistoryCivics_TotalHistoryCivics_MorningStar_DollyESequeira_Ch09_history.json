The memories of the serious disturbances during the Quit India Movement were still fresh; the failure of the INA was an unfortunate end to a heroic phase; and the Muslim League had stepped up its demand for partition. It was in this tense situation that the Viceroy Lord Wavell, who succeeded Lord Linlithgow in October 1943, took a number of measures to ease the situation. First, he had to break the deadlock persisting since the resignation of the Congress Ministries in 1939. Second, he had to create an atmosphere conducive for talks. Therefore, the British Government released the members of the Congress Working Committee, arrested during the Quit India Movement. In order to break the constitutional deadlock he announced a plan, popularly known as the Wavell Plan. The main proposals made under the Wavell Plan included — granting of Dominion Status to India in the long run and drafting of their own Constitution by Indians.\n\nThe Wavell Plan was rejected by the Muslim League because it fell short of its demand for Pakistan. The Congress rejected it as the Plan did not accept the total independence of India from the foreign rule.\n\n[Image: Jawaharlal Nehru welcoming Lord Wavell]"

This was followed by tragic and bloody partition of the country, causing far more grave problems of national reconstruction.\n\nOn the eve of independence, Indian agriculture was backward and stagnant, her industrial development was low and lopsided. There was a near-complete absence for capital goods and machine industries.\n\nIt was the vision and foresight of our national leaders, especially our first Prime Minister, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, which pulled out India from the web of poverty and economic backwardness and laid the strong foundations on which India today proudly stands. It is one of the major industrialised nations of the world. It is also one of the largest as well as one of the fastest growing economies of the world. Above all, it is the largest democracy in the world, committed to peace, disarmament and non-alignment.\n\n[Image: C. Rajagopalachari]\n\n[Image: Dr. Rajendra Prasad]"

The memories of the serious disturbances during the Quit India Movement were still fresh; the failure of the INA was an unfortunate end to a heroic phase; and the Muslim League had stepped up its demand for partition. It was in this tense situation that the Viceroy Lord Wavell, who succeeded Lord Linlithgow in October 1943, took a number of measures to ease the situation. First, he had to break the deadlock persisting since the resignation of the Congress Ministries in 1939. Second, he had to create an atmosphere conducive for talks. Therefore, the British Government released the members of the Congress Working Committee, arrested during the Quit India Movement. In order to break the constitutional deadlock he announced a plan, popularly known as the Wavell Plan. The main proposals made under the Wavell Plan included — granting of Dominion Status to India in the long run and drafting of their own Constitution by Indians.\n\nThe Wavell Plan was rejected by the Muslim League because it fell short of its demand for Pakistan. The Congress rejected it as the Plan did not accept the total independence of India from the foreign rule.\n\n[Image: Jawaharlal Nehru welcoming Lord Wavell]"

There was a near-complete absence for capital goods and machine industries.\n\nIt was the vision and foresight of our national leaders, especially our first Prime Minister, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, which pulled out India from the web of poverty and economic backwardness and laid the strong foundations on which India today proudly stands. It is one of the major industrialised nations of the world. It is also one of the largest as well as one of the fastest growing economies of the world.
